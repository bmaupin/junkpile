			<title>PolyCast Episode 246: Swip It Good</title>
			<description>In the 'News' (01m57s), a Civilization Revolution 2 Plus delay announcement causes more consternation over its timing than its message, Civilization V lands back in a Steam top-sales year ranking (06m42s) and a patch for Civilization: Beyond Earth -- Rising Tide cleans up some of the expansion's release messes (12m25s). In the 'Research Lab' (15m57s), morphing from playing one civilization to another over the course of a given game leads to tie-ins to not one, but two, discussions over the course of the show's most previous season. Under 'Miscellaneous' (21m15s), an extension of a conversation about a survey from Civilization publisher 2K Games further examines the lifecycle of a game in the series (recorded for Episode 243). Then under the 'Open Mic' (29m25s), fittingly an extended dialogue over the show's 2015 Christmas Special prompts a similar treatment on-air; then, on the promise of more to follow next episode, highlights from both the PolyCast and TurnCast 2015 Listener Feedback Surveys.</description>

			<title>PolyCast #178: Everything You Want to Talk About</title>
			<description>In 'Interview' (03m04s), diving into celebrating the release of Civilization V: Brave New World in conversation with representatives from its developer, question via email requesting an ability to exclude particular City State types, and from the recording's live chat, about how the developers chose what civilizations to include, leading to a reveal of some that were short-listed but didn't make the cut and why. Then, on making choices with respect to civilization leaders and unique attributes. From varying users in the chat, why the early game gold crunch is 'ouch', overseeing and counteracting the financial Venietian empire and revisiting the unique abilities of Germany and Japan with Zulu on the mind (10m32s). Stemming from the chat still, whether the BNW Artificial Intelligence (AI) considers trade routes when declaring war, the absence of their scaling for map size and a seeming disconnect between the East India Company National Wonder and the Dutch civilization; then, AI considerations for war and a civilization's selection and relations in light of Ideological adoption (18m05s). Satisfaction level with the new Cultural, and any consideration for introducing a Religious, Victory condition while balancing both as levels in a One City Challenge; further from the chat, why a civilization is able to vote for itself in the introduced World Congress mechanic and City States' peace and war status as it pertains to dispositions between civilizations (31m35s). Looking for an update on using Modification Packs and Scenarios in multiplayer post-Brave New World; the exclusion of Random Events as seen in Civilization IV's Beyond the Sword expansion, what components were cut if any during development and alternate titles considered for this Civ series expansion as well was where CivV is to go beyond its newest title (42m58). Then in 'Review' (56m15s), from industry views and that of users of BNW, a brief look at two of the former followed by a detailed examination of another: 'delivering exactly what it promises' through late game importance for end game outcomes. Delving into the experience further, 'much more screw your neighbour' given the revamped Culture mechanic and engaging the World Congress (60m51s). The 'forest for the trees' considers the changing faces up and down the warmongering avenue (64m40s), and then being 'no longer locked in' by civilization uniqueness, secondary systems and victory path (73m09s).</description>

			<title>PolyCast Christmas Special 2008: Have a Merry Little Humbug</title>
			<description>'Tis the season for Civving! The show's regular four co-hosts are joined by four co-hosts from its sibling to bid a fond farewell to 2008 in the second annual Christmas Special. First, in the 'Village' (04m41s) a Christmas cityset for Civilization III. 'Generosity' (06m02s) follows with a Christmas Play-by-Email Game of CivIII where scoring is based on gifting to others. For 'Getting' (09m03s), a short joke about the difference between giving and getting at Christmas. Next under 'Poem', the poem 'You Come to Play' by 'CivFan91'... in song form. 'Name' (11m32s) reveals a certain something of one who has been a regular-host from the show's beginning. 'Story' (12m45s) is this special's highlight with 'A Humbug Carol' based on 'A Christmas Carol' by Charles Dickens. Last but not least, with inspiration and some content from a related thread, 'Civmas' (20m45s) presents 'The Twelve Days of Civmas' based on 'The Twelve Days of Christmas' carol.</description>

			<title>PolyCast #59: Not Just a Lame Clip Show</title>
			<description>The show's first composite episode of archived segments. Starting off under 'Miscellaneous' (02m41s), on what is generally different in playing Civilization IV against other humans versus the Artificial Intelligence (AI). The 'Research Lab' (04m58s) tries its hand at adjusting Civ cities' tax rate city-by-city. In the first 'Forum Talk' (06m25s), workers won't stop building forts in Civ IV. The first sitting of the 'Senate' (09m51s) hears the timing of promotions not always being immediate, and on Guided Missiles being underpowered. More 'Forum Talk' (18m47s) yields how much do you write down on your Civ games, lack of diverse gameplay in Civ IV: Colonization, on Civ IV: Beyond the Sword Quests in general, and is it ever worth a rush expansion to complete a Quest. The 'Senate' (37m00s) sits again to consider the combination of the Woodsman III and Medic promotions. Ending on another 'Miscellaneous' (41m47s) note, what is memorable from 2008 in the Civilization world. </description>

			<title>PolyCast #51: Regular Defined Loosely</title>
			<description>In the 'News' (04m43s), three 'Civilization IV: Colonization' items from a preview to one set of screenshots, a second and then a supplement marking its predecessor. Opening the 'Mailbag' (10m42s) to examine feedback on Episode 50 with Sid Meier then John 'bt_oz' on being a longtime listener now guest co-hosting for the first time. The 'Senate' docket (16m58s) addresses justifying the flanking promotion, when 'All Hell Broke Loose' and how Sid's Sushi Co. can be really dangerous in 'Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword'. Dan's recurring 'Top Ten' list series returns in a 'Miscellaneous' (24m46s) segment: this time, ranking '1000 Clues You Play Civ IV Too Much'. 'Forum Talk' (27m44s) considers a unit-per-tile limit in Civ, why can't ships be sunk by Fighters and/or Bombers, and in Civ4Col choosing which nation you become after independence. A second 'Miscellaneous' (37m55s) look is an interlude of sorts: a suggestion for what could be the Civ series theme song.</description>

			<title>PolyCast #40: They Do Have Bananas</title>
			<description>In the 'News' (06m27s), what Sid says are the three most important moments in gaming and many-a-preview of Civilization: Revolution. On 'Forum Talk' (12m51s), do you change the espionage slider in Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword, do Permanent Alliances make games too easy and what Civ series unit do you miss the most. In the 'Senate' (25m35s), do you place a Forge in every CivIV city, what to do about 'rat traps' and choosing between building Grenadiers and Riflemen. Playing in the 'Theatre' (34m31s) are some of the biggest blunders in CivIV, led off by a tale from Civilization III.</description>

			<description>In the 'News' (04m06s), Electronic Arts says that they'll buy Take-Two Interactive, but are told maybe later. Then there's the making of Civilization IV with Lead Designer Soren Johnson. On 'Forum Talk' (14m10s) a greater use for Artillery, particularly defensively, is explored prompted by a listener's suggestion, what to do about the Stealth Destroyer the Civ IV expansion Beyond the Sword introduced, and addressing the obsolescence of Castles in-game. The 'Research Lab' (26m35s) looks at what allure civilization-specific events hold. Then in the 'Senate' (30m36s), is it necessary to improve every tile and does razing make Civ games too easy.</description>

			<title>PolyCast Christmas Special 2007: Girls Playing Civ</title>
			<description>It's true that girls other than MAKI play Civ and this is the proof. First-time guest co-hosts ANNALEE, GLORIA and KELLY round out an all-female panel special. As the show's Christmas edition, it's 50% longer than your standard episode. As the four play into the stereotype that women hop topics every few minutes, the combination allows them to discuss dozens of topics on the venerable game series. Their secrets are out!</description>

			<title>PolyCast #34: Don't Drink and Civ</title>
			<description>METHOS is back and in need of some direction. He also displays behaviour that reminds DAN, WOUTER and MAKI of their absent colleague and point it out several times over. DAN asks WOUTER to provide details on some feedback he gave in response to the last episode and vaguely alludes to something different coming in the next. WOUTER and MAKI also hint at it, but METHOS is still not certain what they're getting at.</description>

There is also a significant-and-not-so-significant point as to why this episode's number is worth noting. Something about the rarest resource combo makes it into the chatter and then someone learns that the no singing rule is a bit of an exclusive club.</description>

			<description>After guest co-hosts MATT and LEE become acquainted, IMRAN does not wait another moment to talk about a comparison between an in-game leader and a commercial entity. The two guests, DAN, WOUTER and MAKI let him take the lead after which DAN provides a similar example. A quickly becoming popular screenshot from an upcoming game makes a verbal appearance, and how long to play a turn is explored in humourous depth.</description>

			<description>JOE makes a noise that catches the attention of first IMRAN, then MAKI, and also apparently WOUTER by association. DAN has a ditty for WOUTER and his admirer, though IMRAN has a theory about their identity that is very much his own. A bit of barbarian obsession ensues on religion founding and vassalization, but DAN also raises a topic that leaves all others speechless.</description>

DAN and OSCAR later get serious about interpreting a forum thread title in a manner other than was intended but TONY just has to take it one step too far. He is then one to bring up a topic for its title that is taken more literally to which OSCAR is desperate to find a solution for.</description>

			<title>PolyCast #29: Can of Worms</title>
			<description>KEN prompts TONY and OSCAR to admit that they already knew of each other, followed by WOUTER calling for a quick change of subject after DAN alludes to a taboo subject. OSCAR brings up not one but two luscious leaders in which TONY partakes, and then DAN asks OSCAR just how well he knew what he had gotten himself into now.</description>

			<title>PolyCast #28: CivJunction, What's Your Function?</title>
			<description>From a change in expectations to what forum threads he really likes to see, METHOS makes an impression though his pronunciation of MAKI's handle has to be heard to be believed. The two along with DAN, WOUTER and IMRAN aim to differentiate between three easily familiar terms and IMRAN sings a song with an eerily familiar ring to it. Elsewhere DAN asks METHOS many questions and WOUTER clarifies his names.</description>

			<title>PolyCast #27: Don't Say Simplified (Part 2)</title>
			<description>No rest for the weird and wired. DORIAN gets a refreshment while BARRY is ready to continue; this prompts IMRAN to render assistance and MAKI to offer the response. MATT's speechless, DAN may have found a new means through which to get sponsorship for the show, and WOUTER gets a one-worded answer to a many-worded question.</description>

			<description>DAN credits WOUTER but sets him up in the process, IMRAN suggests why BARRY and DORIAN may really be present while MAKI and MATT undoubtedly shake their heads in amazement. After a shot is made at a mode of multiplayer, why one person wants to swear and another would not be offended by it. It also appears as though a warning while acknowledged went unheeded.</description>

			<title>PolyCast #25: One List to Guide Them All</title>
			<description>It's the show's silver episode anniversary, so the main topic of conversation is as extensive as it is extended. DANQ, MAKI, IMRAN, MING, SOLVER and DANT are back where two of them introduce this outing. Several other co-hosts make cameo appearances of a sort as previously unpublished clips of them are vaulted forward where a theme may or may not play a part. Here's to still being forever suggestively young!</description>

			<title>PolyCast #24: Let's Get It On</title>
			<description>IMRAN is so distracted by where MAKI has been that he doesn't quite get MING's introduction right. He reluctantly greets DANQ, optimistically DANT, and nudges SOLVER to say hello. Phone ringing reminds IMRAN of a certain intro, and DANQ gets him back in focus by leading in doing something MAKI would rather forget. MING then rubs it in. IMRAN can't bring himself to insult as usual but takes another low road instead.</description>

DEREK talks about how not to romance a woman and his colourful gaming roots which has TONY scared, DAN and WOUTER speechless and MARK proposing a drastic solution. They all take a moment to also reflect on the atmosphere of the show and who will regret missing out on all the fun.</description>

A dedication for a certain reviewer of and your questions on Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword -- plus those from the regular co-hosts' -- are answered! Ultimately DAN prompts JON into an admission of a secret. WOUTER moans, MAKI runs and IMRAN's holding the door for anyone who wants to follow him.</description>

			<description>MAKI attempts to keep DAN, IMRAN and returning guest co-host KENNETH at bay when discussing who the most beaudacious babe in Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword is, but for some reason it's a recurring topic. IMRAN may sound different, but between his keyboard and comments it's not difficult to discern it's the same IMRAN. A pre-Settler MOD cannot keep DAN and IMRAN from dragging MAKI into the babe chatter.</description>

The more things change, the more they stay the same for he gets DAN and MAKI's names right but not WOUTER's... but he does offer an explanation for once though. IMRAN then takes another go at getting hatemail.</description>

After yet more Beyond the Sword chatter DAN spoils so-called upcoming coverage on this expansion, WOUTER falls back into old habits, COSTAS asks about naming a certain something and it's MAKI's turn to talk about something shiny.</description>

MAKI's waking up, DAN's scaring WOUTER and guest co-host DALE can't wait to share exclusive goodies on his contribution to this second CivIV expansion pack. Not long after DAN makes it easier for MAKI to accept a certain reality by taking the blame while worrying WOUTER may not be as observant as previously thought.</description>

DAN's busy singing a little something from a song referenced on Apolyton's forums and reading excerpts of twisted quote sayings from CFC, while WOUTER makes a move on MAKI. After the five reflect on several of the show's more vocal naysayers, RICH helps MAKI out of a jam and JOE reveals another effort at participation.</description>

Then when MAKI has a question for DAN, IMRAN is the one who gladly answers it. WOUTER closes the show with a classic.</description>

KENNETH looks at the Giant Death Robots in Beyond the Sword while MAKI's admiring her forests and WOUTER is ranting about obscure Indonesian kingdoms.</description>

As guest co-host KENNETH takes his first step towards squeezing one of the core team members out, DAN makes note of MAKI's aptly renamed blog and the conversation takes... expected turns. After MAKI and KENNETH trade barbs over a long-running Democracy Game (DG), IMRAN leads all in a calming prayer.</description>

DAN names a power for himself and each of his fellow co-hosts, but some are looking to swap or suggest alternatives altogether. IMRAN leads this crew in the closing, though others do what they can to take over the spotlight.</description>

Some are letting their voices be heard by the community for the first time. Join the anticipatory party!</description>

			<description>IMRAN has to cancel at the last moment, but DAN manages to quickly get a hold of BLAKE and agreed to fill in! He is justly rewarded for this (or not). MAKI's here but WOUTER was not able to check in at all, and DAN offers his theory on that. Later he looks more at a rich people list and what any of the co-hosts being on that list would have resulted in. DAN then leads the trio in farewell and somehow manages to compliment himself.</description>

Later DAN and MAKI try to cite a word that best represents themselves, but WOUTER finds that his is already picked out for him.</description>

Fresh from a response to an an apology call, later listen to who's singing now and what part BLAKE didn't want cut (and isn't) from the show. All the while MAKALUHA takes these events and more in stride.</description>

SAVA then drops reference to a well-known member in Civ community in an effort to underlie his importance but fails. Later IMRAN can't name just one of his problems so he refers to them all. He then demonstrates why singing may be one of them.</description>

IMRAN is busy elsewhere and LOCUTUS is no where to be found, so in guest co-hosting DAUPHIN starts the "name game" of those who listen to the show only to bring it down. Later, learn how two of the co-hosts tactfully tie a movie mention to Civ. A certain spamming of forums and how to resolve the matter is also talked about. The last word goes to DAUPHIN.</description>

			<description>When LOCUTUS is missing in action and MAKALUHA pre-occupied, DANQ and IMRAN take the reigns as a dynamic duo once again. The show's value for insomniacs and a listener's interest in more varied discussions are addressed in the opening minutes. Just before ending time, a select choice of spam is made fun of including a zinger or two. Perhaps predictably, the topic of conversation gets back to... basics.</description>

Under the wire this prolific individual reflects on allowing the community to choose his new custom forum title.</description>

			<description>With LOCUTUS at a Dutch PolyMeet and MAKI reportedly dating some admirers, DANQ and IMRAN are left to hold down the fort outpost. Near the finish, DANQ finds himself unusually agreeing with IMRAN when he suggests a shoutout to a number of users on Apolyton's forums for a particular reason. IMRAN then directs some words to a nameless naysayer and asks a question that makes DANQ grateful to be saved by the theme song.</description>

			<title>PolyCast #03: The View From Here</title>
			<description>DANQ is confused, IMRAN is misleading, MAKI is surprised and LOCUTUS takes it all in at the start. Later IMRAN talks about the value of his name that could have been, and then the co-hosts address one of the show's more vocal audience members in its forum during which DANQ's geek level apparently suffers a minor blow. Soon IMRAN focuses attention back on himself for getting stuck on a catchphrase and not signing-off without it.</description>

			<title>PolyCast #02: Second Time Around</title>
			<description>The pressure is on to follow-up the premiere with another strong start... so the co-hosts begin by talking about the reception to the first episode instead! IMRAN manages to catch DANQ's ire but DANQ doesn't get mad: he gets even. Later, LOCUTUS' obsession with a particular weakness surfaces again to denegerate discussion even further. Amazingly, content manages to squeeze itself in between.</description>

			<title>PolyCast #01: Let's Get It Started</title>
			<description>The episode that launched the series. IMRAN introduces himself and his fellow co-hosts but very quickly DANQ takes the opportunity to offer a public service netiquette lesson on email usage. At the end, DANQ offers not only sets up an insult at his own expense, but also explains the supposed origins of the name of the show. Best to take the tale with a few grains of salt.</description>
