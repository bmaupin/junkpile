Wordpress Site Plugins
--
**Note:** This plugin is quite ancient and was last working with WordPress 3.1.4. Use at your own risk.

Creates a Site Plugins page, much like the Site Themes page (wp-admin/wpmu-themes.php) that comes with Wordpress MU.  Allows admins to enable or disable (remove from blog Plugins page--wp-admin/plugins.php) plugins sitewide as well as to activate or deactivate a specific plugin for a specific blog (useful when plugins have been disabled).
