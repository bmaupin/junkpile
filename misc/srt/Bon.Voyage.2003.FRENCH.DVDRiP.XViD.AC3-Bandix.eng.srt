1
00:01:54,775 --> 00:01:56,880
Forgive me.

2
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,835
I'm falling at your feet...

3
00:01:59,031 --> 00:02:00,591
...blinded by admiration!

4
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:01,936
Mr. Minister....

5
00:02:02,135 --> 00:02:04,437
I mean it. I'm pleased to meet you.

6
00:02:04,631 --> 00:02:07,052
I can't say I saw the film.

7
00:02:07,255 --> 00:02:07,953
Really?

8
00:02:08,152 --> 00:02:10,541
I only saw you. The film can wait.

9
00:02:10,743 --> 00:02:14,005
You light up troubled times.

10
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,127
Did it shock you?

11
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:17,261
Lord, no! It's what we need.

12
00:02:17,463 --> 00:02:19,154
A little escapism.

13
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:22,548
And with you around,
all our worries fade.

14
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:28,624
Will there be a war?

15
00:02:28,824 --> 00:02:32,402
Please! People ask me that
1 00 times a day.

16
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,006
Not you....

17
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:35,922
Not tonight!

18
00:03:16,503 --> 00:03:17,997
See you Thursday!

19
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,606
Viviane!

20
00:03:36,663 --> 00:03:38,835
-Go away!
-Listen!

21
00:03:39,031 --> 00:03:41,038
You can tell them what you like!

22
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:26,700
Mr. Auger! Phone!

23
00:04:40,023 --> 00:04:41,714
It's you.

24
00:04:41,912 --> 00:04:43,854
How did you get my number?

25
00:04:44,055 --> 00:04:45,778
You called her in Dijon?

26
00:04:45,975 --> 00:04:47,666
She must have wondered.

27
00:04:47,863 --> 00:04:49,554
Can I what?

28
00:04:49,751 --> 00:04:51,725
Slow down, I don't understand.

29
00:04:54,423 --> 00:04:56,944
It's late. Why not tomorrow morning?

30
00:04:58,071 --> 00:05:00,624
I am pleased. What's going on?

31
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:04,086
I'm pleased, I said. Just calm down.

32
00:05:04,952 --> 00:05:06,675
I don't have your address.

33
00:05:06,872 --> 00:05:08,278
Just a second.

34
00:05:09,783 --> 00:05:11,277
Let me note it.

35
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:51,988
Where have you been?
I was worried. Come in.

36
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,547
Are you cold? You're shivering.

37
00:05:58,743 --> 00:06:01,231
-It's emotion.
-At seeing me again?

38
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:03,570
It's been a long time.

39
00:06:03,768 --> 00:06:05,328
Nice place.

40
00:06:05,527 --> 00:06:06,672
It's not finished.

41
00:06:06,871 --> 00:06:08,627
I saw it in a magazine, but--

42
00:06:08,823 --> 00:06:09,619
Keep it on.

43
00:06:09,815 --> 00:06:11,157
We're not staying in?

44
00:06:11,351 --> 00:06:12,333
What, then?

45
00:06:12,535 --> 00:06:13,680
Come on.

46
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:16,748
What's wrong, Viviane?
What's happened?

47
00:06:17,623 --> 00:06:18,768
That.

48
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,023
-Is he...?
-Yes, he fell.

49
00:06:27,223 --> 00:06:28,433
From up there?

50
00:06:28,631 --> 00:06:30,867
-You were down here?
-No, up there.

51
00:06:31,063 --> 00:06:31,826
Did you...?

52
00:06:32,023 --> 00:06:33,997
No, I didn't! He slipped.

53
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:35,213
He just fell?

54
00:06:35,415 --> 00:06:36,942
-I slapped him.
-Why?

55
00:06:37,143 --> 00:06:39,314
He was drunk. He pounced on me.

56
00:06:51,255 --> 00:06:52,466
What can we do?

57
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:54,551
What do you mean?

58
00:06:57,335 --> 00:06:58,262
Stop!

59
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:01,068
Don't touch anything!

60
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:03,348
I'll call the police.

61
00:07:05,495 --> 00:07:06,869
Not the police!

62
00:07:07,063 --> 00:07:08,525
Let me handle it.

63
00:07:08,727 --> 00:07:10,832
-It's an accident!
-Who'd believe that?

64
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:13,486
It was self-defense! He slipped.

65
00:07:13,687 --> 00:07:16,916
Honestly, Frédéric,
can't you imagine the scandal?

66
00:07:17,111 --> 00:07:19,631
The papers will only hound me with it.

67
00:07:20,503 --> 00:07:21,747
Think of my new film!

68
00:07:21,943 --> 00:07:24,463
-Try to calm down.
-Leave me.

69
00:07:24,663 --> 00:07:28,143
I was wrong. I thought you could--
I don't know--

70
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:30,771
That you'd help me.

71
00:07:59,735 --> 00:08:01,164
-What did he do?
-Who?

72
00:08:01,367 --> 00:08:03,701
-Him!
-Business.

73
00:08:03,895 --> 00:08:05,750
-What kind?
-All kinds.

74
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,309
He backed Midnight Ball.
You saw it?

75
00:08:08,503 --> 00:08:10,837
-Of course.
-Put him down!

76
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:14,704
-Did you like it?
-What?

77
00:08:14,903 --> 00:08:16,463
The film.

78
00:08:17,015 --> 00:08:18,575
Sort of.

79
00:08:18,774 --> 00:08:21,076
-Did I sing well?
-Very well.

80
00:08:21,271 --> 00:08:25,297
I was dubbed.
I'm so pleased you couldn't tell.

81
00:08:25,494 --> 00:08:27,829
-What do you want?
-His car keys.

82
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:31,058
-He's bleeding.
-He fell.

83
00:08:31,254 --> 00:08:32,596
Come on.

84
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:43,639
-It's a river?
-No, a canal.

85
00:08:43,831 --> 00:08:45,587
-Is it deep?
-Don't worry.

86
00:08:45,783 --> 00:08:48,598
-Want me to come?
-No, go back inside.

87
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,546
Clean everything up!

88
00:08:50,743 --> 00:08:52,270
I'll call you tomorrow.

89
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:56,178
-I knew it.
-What?

90
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,302
That you'd help.

91
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,055
You'd forgotten me.

92
00:08:59,255 --> 00:09:00,237
Forgotten?

93
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,446
You never got in touch.

94
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:06,002
Your life was too crowded.

95
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:12,428
WAR OR PEACE?

96
00:10:19,351 --> 00:10:21,260
PEACE AT STAKE

97
00:10:25,943 --> 00:10:29,107
THE MYSTERIOUS DEATH
OF ANDRÉ ARPEL

98
00:11:04,054 --> 00:11:05,997
Please don't get up.

99
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:08,662
Forgive me.

100
00:11:08,854 --> 00:11:10,381
It's hard to reach you.

101
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,371
Yes, these days....

102
00:11:13,111 --> 00:11:14,093
What is it?

103
00:11:14,295 --> 00:11:17,142
You seem tired.
Are events worrying you?

104
00:11:17,334 --> 00:11:18,861
No, it's not that.

105
00:11:19,735 --> 00:11:21,229
Can I confide in you?

106
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,056
You said such kind things to me.

107
00:11:23,254 --> 00:11:24,182
Please do.

108
00:11:25,463 --> 00:11:28,114
Did you know André Arpel?
He's dead.

109
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,139
I know.

110
00:11:29,335 --> 00:11:32,150
I knew him long ago.
Perhaps you heard?

111
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,637
I'd stopped seeing him.

112
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:38,963
Now the police want to see me
next week, but I won't go.

113
00:11:40,663 --> 00:11:42,190
Are you listening?

114
00:11:42,391 --> 00:11:43,798
Why won't you go?

115
00:11:43,991 --> 00:11:46,358
Can you imagine the papers?

116
00:11:47,223 --> 00:11:49,110
They have bigger concerns.

117
00:11:49,303 --> 00:11:50,645
You don't know them.

118
00:11:50,838 --> 00:11:52,147
I don't?

119
00:11:55,671 --> 00:11:56,947
Why are you here?

120
00:11:57,143 --> 00:11:59,085
I refuse to see the police.

121
00:11:59,895 --> 00:12:01,585
I'm not the police chief.

122
00:12:01,783 --> 00:12:03,343
You could call him.

123
00:12:03,543 --> 00:12:05,747
Perhaps. I'll think about it.

124
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:07,729
Jeanne Lanvin.

125
00:12:08,374 --> 00:12:09,302
I'm sorry?

126
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,317
Your perfume.

127
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,885
Yes, Scandal.

128
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:15,118
I'm very fond of it.

129
00:12:15,894 --> 00:12:17,455
You could call him now.

130
00:12:17,655 --> 00:12:19,182
-Who?
-The police chief.

131
00:12:19,382 --> 00:12:22,350
I can't just now,
but I will. I promise.

132
00:12:24,182 --> 00:12:28,306
I don't know why you're
so worried over nothing.

133
00:12:28,503 --> 00:12:30,543
Didn't they arrest his killer?

134
00:12:42,774 --> 00:12:46,571
Mr. Auger? I'm Vouriot,
your court-appointed lawyer.

135
00:12:46,774 --> 00:12:50,003
I can't take care of you now.
I've been called up.

136
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:52,588
-I leave tomorrow.
-But who--?

137
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,252
I'll be back soon.

138
00:12:54,454 --> 00:12:56,626
It'll all be over in three weeks.

139
00:12:56,822 --> 00:12:59,310
Not even Hitler wants war.

140
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,420
He'll make peace, you'll see.

141
00:13:01,622 --> 00:13:04,143
So behave. You're better off here.

142
00:13:04,983 --> 00:13:06,444
Seen the magistrate?

143
00:13:06,647 --> 00:13:09,516
Of course.
Things are all over the place.

144
00:13:09,718 --> 00:13:12,206
I've read your statement.

145
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:16,624
We'll see about that later.
So you stole the car?

146
00:13:17,623 --> 00:13:20,525
Not knowing the owner
was in the trunk?

147
00:13:22,998 --> 00:13:25,365
Tell the police what you like...

148
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:28,461
...but be straight with me
or get another lawyer.

149
00:13:28,662 --> 00:13:30,767
What did you do with the gun?

150
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:32,014
What gun?

151
00:13:32,215 --> 00:13:35,084
That fellow, Arpel, had been shot.

152
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:37,584
You didn't know that?

153
00:13:43,543 --> 00:13:48,628
A few months later....

154
00:14:15,735 --> 00:14:16,750
Everybody out.

155
00:14:16,951 --> 00:14:18,413
-What's up?
-We're leaving.

156
00:14:18,615 --> 00:14:20,622
-What's going on?
-The Germans are coming!

157
00:14:20,823 --> 00:14:23,473
-Where are they?
-A day away. Want to wait?

158
00:15:04,343 --> 00:15:06,383
-Cut it out!
-Do you mind?

159
00:15:19,414 --> 00:15:21,553
Any idea where they're taking us?

160
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,474
Down South. Where else?

161
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:26,354
We won't be alone on the roads.
This'll be fun.

162
00:15:33,143 --> 00:15:34,288
Come on.

163
00:15:34,486 --> 00:15:35,981
What are you doing?

164
00:15:51,254 --> 00:15:52,432
Shut up!

165
00:16:05,558 --> 00:16:06,965
Your turn.

166
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,852
Don't stay here!

167
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:33,555
Bloody thing!

168
00:17:03,414 --> 00:17:06,731
June 1 4, 1 940

169
00:17:28,118 --> 00:17:29,263
Who?

170
00:17:31,831 --> 00:17:34,198
Viviane Denvert?
No, she's not here.

171
00:17:34,774 --> 00:17:37,425
There's no one left,
no films, nothing.

172
00:17:38,582 --> 00:17:39,564
What?

173
00:17:40,215 --> 00:17:42,768
I don't know, sir,
probably in Bordeaux.

174
00:17:43,638 --> 00:17:46,638
They've all fled there,
all the upper crust.

175
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:50,160
I'm staying here.

176
00:17:51,094 --> 00:17:52,371
I'm learning German.

177
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,285
Your papers!

178
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,307
Are you crazy?

179
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,965
Just a bit of fun.
How come you're here?

180
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,628
I got the last train too.

181
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,618
-Going to Bordeaux?
-You too?

182
00:19:13,814 --> 00:19:16,302
You bet.
That's where it's all happening.

183
00:19:16,502 --> 00:19:18,029
How did you get away?

184
00:19:18,231 --> 00:19:20,686
I'll tell you later. Come on.

185
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,652
Here. I couldn't find a glass.

186
00:19:36,854 --> 00:19:38,447
That's all right.

187
00:19:45,462 --> 00:19:47,437
Blimey! You needed that.

188
00:19:48,182 --> 00:19:50,070
This is a friend, Mr....

189
00:19:50,262 --> 00:19:51,190
Auger.

190
00:19:51,383 --> 00:19:52,560
Mr. Auger.

191
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,217
She's at the Collège de France.

192
00:19:55,414 --> 00:19:57,618
-Don't say that!
-It's not true?

193
00:19:57,814 --> 00:19:59,636
Look, no one cares.

194
00:20:02,998 --> 00:20:04,373
What did I say?

195
00:20:05,431 --> 00:20:07,765
She gets off in Angoulême.
Too bad.

196
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,517
You'll catch your death here.

197
00:20:13,719 --> 00:20:14,799
I'm all right.

198
00:20:14,998 --> 00:20:18,511
The nuns can give you a seat.
I'll say you're ill.

199
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,052
I'm not ill.

200
00:20:20,246 --> 00:20:21,839
-It's absurd.
-I'll be back.

201
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,914
Is your friend always like that?

202
00:20:29,878 --> 00:20:31,155
You know him well?

203
00:20:31,351 --> 00:20:33,489
Not very well. He did me a favor.

204
00:20:34,231 --> 00:20:35,343
Must be a habit.

205
00:20:35,543 --> 00:20:37,397
He just can't help himself.

206
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,957
Do you want to sit down?

207
00:20:47,702 --> 00:20:49,775
You're at the Collège de France?

208
00:20:49,974 --> 00:20:51,884
I'm just an assistant.

209
00:20:52,662 --> 00:20:54,069
In a physics lab.

210
00:20:55,158 --> 00:20:56,303
What do you do?

211
00:20:57,974 --> 00:20:59,381
I've done a lot of things.

212
00:20:59,574 --> 00:21:00,818
Like what?

213
00:21:01,014 --> 00:21:03,054
I started out as a--

214
00:21:03,254 --> 00:21:04,748
Well, I was in a--

215
00:21:05,494 --> 00:21:07,861
But that didn't last long. Then I--

216
00:21:08,054 --> 00:21:09,548
You weren't called up?

217
00:21:09,751 --> 00:21:12,598
No, I was....
I was away, that's why.

218
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,764
Where were you?

219
00:21:15,254 --> 00:21:17,262
-Abroad?
-Abroad, yes.

220
00:21:17,974 --> 00:21:20,243
It took a while to get back.

221
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,219
I had to find a boat.

222
00:21:44,534 --> 00:21:46,541
Professor!

223
00:21:49,111 --> 00:21:50,158
Wait!

224
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,397
You'll hurt yourself.

225
00:21:53,622 --> 00:21:57,234
Camille! We thought
you'd never get here.

226
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,951
It kept stopping.
I almost went mad.

227
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,638
-How are you, Mr. Girard?
-I'm all right.

228
00:22:04,662 --> 00:22:06,069
We'll meet again?

229
00:22:07,062 --> 00:22:08,469
Where's the Collège de France?

230
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:11,120
You have all the papers?

231
00:22:11,318 --> 00:22:13,969
I took everything I found in the lab.

232
00:22:15,222 --> 00:22:18,354
Your attention, please.
Following an air raid...

233
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:21,845
...traffic is suspended
until further notice.

234
00:22:22,902 --> 00:22:25,804
Would all passengers
please leave the train.

235
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,826
My case! Get my case!

236
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,325
-How will you manage in England?
-I'll see.

237
00:22:37,526 --> 00:22:38,736
No one's expecting you.

238
00:22:38,934 --> 00:22:40,657
I have friends there.

239
00:22:40,854 --> 00:22:43,188
I must leave France, Camille, my dear.

240
00:22:43,734 --> 00:22:46,767
The Germans will be here
in a week or even sooner.

241
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,041
What?

242
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,735
You took them?

243
00:22:54,934 --> 00:22:56,822
Yes, it was safer that way.

244
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,708
But the trucks....

245
00:22:58,902 --> 00:23:00,942
I didn't quite trust them.

246
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:11,792
-When does the boat leave?
-Tomorrow.

247
00:23:12,502 --> 00:23:13,931
Are you going too?

248
00:23:14,134 --> 00:23:16,436
No, I can't. Because of Mother.

249
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,964
Broken hips are tricky.

250
00:23:20,182 --> 00:23:21,709
I haven't heard from her.

251
00:23:22,742 --> 00:23:24,945
Going to Bordeaux, by any chance?

252
00:23:50,102 --> 00:23:53,168
Don't worry.
They've been so helpful.

253
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:56,398
Where are they from? Paris?

254
00:23:56,822 --> 00:23:58,164
I think so.

255
00:24:07,862 --> 00:24:09,323
Don't touch, gentlemen!

256
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:13,869
She's asleep, sir.

257
00:25:17,878 --> 00:25:20,300
Oh, no! For pity's sake!

258
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,932
It's late. You have to get up.

259
00:25:23,126 --> 00:25:26,225
I didn't sleep a wink.
This place is so noisy.

260
00:25:26,422 --> 00:25:28,594
I know. No one slept a wink.

261
00:25:29,109 --> 00:25:32,012
The president and the government
have arrived.

262
00:25:32,214 --> 00:25:34,003
I had to work all night.

263
00:25:34,198 --> 00:25:35,791
Poor Jean-Etienne.

264
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:37,077
I have to go.

265
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,506
Go later. Get some sleep now.

266
00:25:40,981 --> 00:25:42,258
The cabinet's convening.

267
00:25:42,454 --> 00:25:45,007
Think of an excuse. Send a note.

268
00:25:49,621 --> 00:25:50,669
You can barely stand.

269
00:25:52,374 --> 00:25:54,513
-I saw the de Lusses.
-They're here?

270
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,620
They had to sleep in their car.

271
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:57,804
You're joking!

272
00:25:58,006 --> 00:26:00,308
Go and see.
They're parked outside.

273
00:26:01,397 --> 00:26:02,445
1 27, please.

274
00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:04,717
Beaufort here.

275
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:09,556
Did you reach the command? Who?

276
00:26:10,294 --> 00:26:11,439
And?

277
00:26:15,382 --> 00:26:19,310
Jacqueline, sleeping in the street!
I must tell everybody.

278
00:26:25,974 --> 00:26:27,152
I'm on my way.

279
00:26:28,918 --> 00:26:30,347
What's wrong?

280
00:26:30,742 --> 00:26:32,236
They've reached Orléans.

281
00:26:32,982 --> 00:26:34,291
Already?

282
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,487
Darling!

283
00:27:05,942 --> 00:27:07,152
I'm half-dead!

284
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:10,863
You've no idea what Albert and I
have been through.

285
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:15,059
Not just the exhaustion,
but the humiliation.

286
00:27:15,702 --> 00:27:17,076
They're monsters here.

287
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,579
Know where I slept?

288
00:27:18,774 --> 00:27:19,756
Not in the car?

289
00:27:21,878 --> 00:27:24,628
Still, it's good to know
you have a room.

290
00:27:25,654 --> 00:27:27,661
-Want to take a bath?
-Later.

291
00:27:28,053 --> 00:27:31,250
I have to eat something,
or I'm going to faint.

292
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,423
Shall I come with you?

293
00:27:33,622 --> 00:27:34,898
Twin beds, remember.

294
00:27:35,094 --> 00:27:37,068
Look, it's not a travel agency.

295
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:41,809
Albert claims I'm restless,
but no man ever complained before.

296
00:27:42,998 --> 00:27:43,926
What is it?

297
00:27:53,334 --> 00:27:54,195
Alex!

298
00:27:55,414 --> 00:27:56,690
Viviane.

299
00:27:56,886 --> 00:27:59,220
Did they give you my note last night?

300
00:27:59,414 --> 00:28:00,691
Yes, but I can't.

301
00:28:00,886 --> 00:28:02,512
-You're not free?
-Not for dinner.

302
00:28:02,709 --> 00:28:03,986
Lunch, then?

303
00:28:04,181 --> 00:28:05,261
It's not easy.

304
00:28:05,462 --> 00:28:07,153
Surely we can have a drink?

305
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,554
Maybe. I'll let you know.

306
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,848
I hoped it would be easier
to see you down here.

307
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,379
I'm not a minister.

308
00:28:15,574 --> 00:28:18,225
But that could be a blessing right now.

309
00:28:19,702 --> 00:28:22,222
-Still following you.
-His paper sent him.

310
00:28:22,421 --> 00:28:24,658
-He's mad about you.
-Honestly!

311
00:28:24,854 --> 00:28:27,188
He even said so at the Gramonts'.

312
00:28:27,382 --> 00:28:31,276
That you embodied French grace.
His meaning was clear.

313
00:28:41,142 --> 00:28:42,669
We have to leave.

314
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,015
For the colonies?

315
00:28:44,214 --> 00:28:46,385
Why not? We're trapped here.

316
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:49,039
Move the government to Senegal?

317
00:28:49,718 --> 00:28:51,725
Be reasonable, Brémond.

318
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:54,862
-The war is lost.
-Not yet.

319
00:28:55,061 --> 00:28:56,785
I'm afraid it is.

320
00:28:56,981 --> 00:28:59,403
All we can do is ask for an armistice.

321
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:00,653
Reynaud won't.

322
00:29:00,854 --> 00:29:03,188
Let him resign. The marshal's ready.

323
00:29:03,382 --> 00:29:05,586
-It will take a vote.
-Who'd oppose it?

324
00:29:05,782 --> 00:29:07,211
Two men will.

325
00:29:07,414 --> 00:29:08,396
Who?

326
00:29:08,597 --> 00:29:10,452
-Oh, yes, of course.
-Who?

327
00:29:10,646 --> 00:29:12,369
Mandel and that de Gaulle.

328
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,517
Turn left!

329
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:16,236
We're already late!

330
00:29:21,622 --> 00:29:22,549
Watch it!

331
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:28,401
Did you see that?

332
00:29:30,229 --> 00:29:32,466
There's nothing on Monnet.

333
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,591
Where are you going?
It's not the way!

334
00:29:37,301 --> 00:29:40,301
Weygand should change
points six and nine.

335
00:29:40,502 --> 00:29:41,429
Let me out!

336
00:29:41,622 --> 00:29:42,549
What's wrong?

337
00:29:42,742 --> 00:29:44,597
-I have to buy something.
-Not now!

338
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,066
I won't be long.

339
00:29:54,069 --> 00:29:55,280
Can I help you?

340
00:29:57,174 --> 00:29:59,988
Do you have any...?
I'd like some gloves.

341
00:30:00,181 --> 00:30:01,675
Leather or wool?

342
00:30:01,878 --> 00:30:04,082
I don't know. Leather.

343
00:30:04,277 --> 00:30:05,586
What size?

344
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,724
Could I see your hand?

345
00:30:07,925 --> 00:30:10,991
That looks like a seven.
What color?

346
00:30:11,349 --> 00:30:12,047
The same.

347
00:30:12,246 --> 00:30:13,806
-White?
-That's right.

348
00:30:14,741 --> 00:30:16,497
-They freed you?
-I escaped.

349
00:30:16,694 --> 00:30:18,385
They emptied all the prisons.

350
00:30:18,581 --> 00:30:19,825
You have to hide.

351
00:30:20,022 --> 00:30:21,844
Why? No one cares now.

352
00:30:22,038 --> 00:30:23,980
-I have these.
-I'll take them.

353
00:30:24,181 --> 00:30:25,742
Which ones?

354
00:30:29,782 --> 00:30:31,156
You shot him!

355
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,455
-Arpel. You shot him.
-Stop it!

356
00:30:33,654 --> 00:30:35,628
What did you lie to me for?

357
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,291
Shut up! I'll explain.

358
00:30:37,494 --> 00:30:38,835
Don't move!

359
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,379
Viviane, what are you doing?

360
00:30:46,581 --> 00:30:48,043
It's not bad, is it?

361
00:30:48,245 --> 00:30:51,147
Not bad. Let's go!
How much do I owe you?

362
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,172
With the hat as well?

363
00:30:56,662 --> 00:30:58,964
Sometimes I wonder if you realize....

364
00:31:01,302 --> 00:31:03,757
Isn't that...?
What's her name again?

365
00:31:03,957 --> 00:31:05,037
Viviane Denvert.

366
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:06,831
That's it, Viviane Denvert.

367
00:31:12,597 --> 00:31:14,026
You know her?

368
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:19,313
You know her so-so,
or you know her?

369
00:31:19,509 --> 00:31:21,397
I know her, okay.

370
00:31:22,037 --> 00:31:23,793
You devil! I get it now.

371
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,681
Why you came all this way.

372
00:31:25,877 --> 00:31:26,892
So who's he?

373
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:30,224
Don't you recognize him?
Mr. Beaufort, the minister.

374
00:31:30,741 --> 00:31:33,741
They make a lovely couple,
don't they?

375
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:46,609
Calm down, children!
Not in the house!

376
00:31:47,157 --> 00:31:49,907
The town hall's sending
more mattresses.

377
00:31:54,262 --> 00:31:56,913
We're used to refugees in Bordeaux.

378
00:31:57,109 --> 00:31:58,320
First in 1 870...

379
00:31:58,837 --> 00:32:00,430
...then in 1 91 4.

380
00:32:01,238 --> 00:32:03,758
I only have my son's room left.

381
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:06,030
He's on the road somewhere.

382
00:32:07,477 --> 00:32:09,517
-My bedspread!
-Sorry!

383
00:32:09,718 --> 00:32:11,506
-Can I make a call?
-Locally?

384
00:32:11,701 --> 00:32:13,294
Yes, I'll pay. Don't worry.

385
00:32:13,494 --> 00:32:15,184
The phone's in my room.

386
00:32:23,797 --> 00:32:25,707
Maurice, it's me.

387
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:27,764
Yes, pal, I'm here.

388
00:32:28,214 --> 00:32:30,156
I'll tell you all about it.

389
00:32:31,317 --> 00:32:32,365
Who?

390
00:32:32,821 --> 00:32:35,374
Really? When did they get here?

391
00:32:35,573 --> 00:32:36,621
Auger!

392
00:32:36,981 --> 00:32:38,290
Hold on, Maurice.

393
00:32:39,349 --> 00:32:41,324
Wait! What's the big rush?

394
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,268
You don't know where she is!

395
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,964
I'll find the place.

396
00:32:46,613 --> 00:32:48,140
What are you after?

397
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,610
The government!

398
00:33:23,734 --> 00:33:27,792
We're jam-packed!
That's all there is to it!

399
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:29,451
I wired you two days ago!

400
00:33:29,654 --> 00:33:30,995
Me too, three days ago!

401
00:33:31,189 --> 00:33:32,978
I'm the Countess Roberti.

402
00:33:33,173 --> 00:33:34,101
I'm sorry.

403
00:33:34,294 --> 00:33:36,268
-Get me the manager.
-He's ill.

404
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:38,193
You have fifth-floor rooms.

405
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:40,811
-They're staff rooms.
-They'll do!

406
00:33:41,014 --> 00:33:42,956
They're for the senators.

407
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:47,370
-Miss Denvert.
-She's out.

408
00:33:47,573 --> 00:33:49,362
-Will she...?
-I can't say, sir.

409
00:33:52,149 --> 00:33:54,418
It's all the leftists' fault.

410
00:33:54,614 --> 00:33:57,909
I knew the whole thing
would end in disaster.

411
00:34:00,181 --> 00:34:03,661
Russians in the German army
raped women in Belgium.

412
00:34:24,822 --> 00:34:26,251
Why are you here?

413
00:34:26,453 --> 00:34:27,435
For the professor.

414
00:34:27,637 --> 00:34:28,815
He hasn't left?

415
00:34:29,014 --> 00:34:30,028
But the boat--

416
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,651
He needs official papers
to get onboard.

417
00:34:32,854 --> 00:34:34,348
-Where is he?
-Upstairs.

418
00:34:34,549 --> 00:34:36,883
Caught up in all their red tape.

419
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:39,281
A genius like him! It's maddening!

420
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:44,625
Are you staying here?

421
00:34:45,877 --> 00:34:46,892
Good.

422
00:34:47,093 --> 00:34:49,777
After an hour here, I'm ashamed.

423
00:34:49,973 --> 00:34:52,078
Have you heard these people?

424
00:34:52,277 --> 00:34:55,506
The Germans are in Paris,
and it hardly bothers them.

425
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,863
-Don't you care?
-I do--

426
00:34:59,061 --> 00:35:00,490
No, you don't.

427
00:35:00,693 --> 00:35:03,279
I have other worries. I'm sorry.

428
00:35:03,478 --> 00:35:05,136
At a time like this?

429
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:07,788
You have yours.
The professor, heavy water....

430
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:10,764
You know?

431
00:35:11,253 --> 00:35:12,115
You told me.

432
00:35:12,309 --> 00:35:13,171
I did?

433
00:35:13,365 --> 00:35:15,504
You talked about it in the car.

434
00:35:15,702 --> 00:35:17,709
-Weren't you asleep?
-Not all the time.

435
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:20,364
Is it a secret? What is it exactly?

436
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:25,546
A special chemical compound.
That's all I can say.

437
00:35:26,229 --> 00:35:27,407
All right.

438
00:35:34,358 --> 00:35:38,132
It's the world's only heavy water.
It must reach England.

439
00:35:38,325 --> 00:35:41,674
If the Germans get it,
it'll be a disaster.

440
00:35:41,878 --> 00:35:43,187
Really? Why?

441
00:35:57,301 --> 00:35:59,984
-Am I boring you?
-Excuse me.

442
00:36:01,173 --> 00:36:03,181
What's happening?

443
00:36:03,381 --> 00:36:04,428
I can't say.

444
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:06,036
-We can't go on.
-I know.

445
00:36:06,229 --> 00:36:08,946
-Is the war still on?
-We're deliberating.

446
00:36:09,141 --> 00:36:11,029
It must end. Sue for peace!

447
00:36:13,877 --> 00:36:14,924
You have a room.

448
00:36:15,509 --> 00:36:17,397
Wonderful. In which hotel?

449
00:36:17,589 --> 00:36:19,477
A girls' high school, actually.

450
00:36:19,669 --> 00:36:20,597
Seriously?

451
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,578
I hear it's very comfortable.

452
00:36:22,773 --> 00:36:23,700
That's it!

453
00:36:23,893 --> 00:36:26,992
Albert, if I don't like it,
I'm off to Nice.

454
00:36:27,189 --> 00:36:28,716
Thank you anyway.

455
00:36:30,773 --> 00:36:32,945
May I have a word? Do you mind?

456
00:36:35,957 --> 00:36:38,542
You're crazy!
Someone might recognize you!

457
00:36:38,741 --> 00:36:40,716
-Can't we talk?
-Not now!

458
00:36:55,733 --> 00:36:58,254
Jean-Etienne, meet Frédéric.

459
00:36:58,453 --> 00:37:00,624
He knew my brothers in Dijon.

460
00:37:01,557 --> 00:37:02,703
He lived next door.

461
00:37:02,901 --> 00:37:04,657
Our little neighbor.

462
00:37:04,853 --> 00:37:06,762
How long has it been now?

463
00:37:07,733 --> 00:37:10,067
You haven't changed.
How do you do it?

464
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,400
Viviane, let's have lunch.

465
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:14,768
I'll be down in five minutes.

466
00:37:28,757 --> 00:37:30,579
The military situation looks bad.

467
00:37:30,773 --> 00:37:32,267
We need to talk.

468
00:37:39,797 --> 00:37:40,725
Camille!

469
00:37:43,157 --> 00:37:44,651
Do you have the papers?

470
00:37:44,853 --> 00:37:45,781
What?

471
00:37:45,973 --> 00:37:50,676
They don't seem to understand.
They're too wary to sign anything.

472
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:52,462
They'll be the death of me.

473
00:37:53,877 --> 00:37:54,989
The death of me.

474
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:11,476
I know, I told you a pack of lies.

475
00:38:12,117 --> 00:38:13,132
Let me speak.

476
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,569
He'd been harassing me.

477
00:38:15,765 --> 00:38:16,496
Arpel?

478
00:38:16,693 --> 00:38:19,508
He'd threatened to write
to the press about me.

479
00:38:19,701 --> 00:38:20,628
What for?

480
00:38:20,821 --> 00:38:24,782
Some business
about jewels I borrowed once.

481
00:38:24,981 --> 00:38:26,508
-Who from?
-People.

482
00:38:26,709 --> 00:38:28,781
-You gave them back?
-Most of them.

483
00:38:28,981 --> 00:38:30,835
Really, it was so long ago!

484
00:38:31,029 --> 00:38:31,957
So you shot him?

485
00:38:32,149 --> 00:38:34,964
He scared me.
The gun went off in my hand.

486
00:38:35,157 --> 00:38:36,302
-Whose was it?
-Mine.

487
00:38:36,501 --> 00:38:37,429
And then?

488
00:38:37,621 --> 00:38:39,246
I put it away.

489
00:38:42,261 --> 00:38:46,222
When I saw your photo in the paper,
I almost fainted.

490
00:38:46,901 --> 00:38:50,611
I couldn't even write to you.
They open prisoners' mail.

491
00:38:51,957 --> 00:38:53,102
I cried and cried.

492
00:38:55,093 --> 00:38:56,435
You don't believe me?

493
00:38:58,069 --> 00:38:59,564
I can see you don't.

494
00:39:01,718 --> 00:39:03,725
What will become of us?

495
00:39:07,413 --> 00:39:08,755
Don't be afraid.

496
00:39:16,981 --> 00:39:19,119
Tell them to start without me.

497
00:39:19,317 --> 00:39:20,527
I have to go.

498
00:39:24,693 --> 00:39:25,708
Shall I wait?

499
00:39:25,909 --> 00:39:27,949
No, go! All of Paris is here!

500
00:39:28,149 --> 00:39:29,578
You have a room in town?

501
00:39:29,781 --> 00:39:32,945
Stay in. I'll come over.
Give me the address.

502
00:39:35,509 --> 00:39:38,062
-When?
-When I can. I'm not totally free.

503
00:39:38,261 --> 00:39:40,170
-I noticed. Is that new?
-What?

504
00:39:40,373 --> 00:39:42,707
Beaufort. Your role
supporting the republic.

505
00:39:42,901 --> 00:39:46,162
Please. It's not easy.
Without Jean-Etienne....

506
00:39:56,757 --> 00:39:59,408
Wait! Don't get angry. I'm sorry.

507
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,874
-I'll come to see you.
-At Christmas?

508
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:04,458
-Why are you like this?
-I was in jail!

509
00:40:04,661 --> 00:40:06,701
And for whom? I never shot anyone!

510
00:40:06,901 --> 00:40:08,210
Shut up!

511
00:40:25,397 --> 00:40:27,185
Mr. Beaufort would like a word.

512
00:40:29,749 --> 00:40:32,564
You left in such a rush.
Join us for lunch.

513
00:40:33,269 --> 00:40:35,506
Come along.
Viviane will be delighted.

514
00:40:35,701 --> 00:40:38,286
She hasn't seen you in so long.

515
00:40:48,181 --> 00:40:50,701
I had a few questions for you.

516
00:40:51,541 --> 00:40:55,338
Viviane can be so nebulous.
It's hard to know anything.

517
00:40:56,181 --> 00:40:57,872
Was she married in Dijon?

518
00:40:58,069 --> 00:40:59,051
Married? No.

519
00:40:59,253 --> 00:41:00,430
She drove boys wild?

520
00:41:00,629 --> 00:41:01,556
I imagine so.

521
00:41:01,749 --> 00:41:04,400
What do you mean?
You lived next door.

522
00:41:05,749 --> 00:41:07,091
Sit down.

523
00:41:07,637 --> 00:41:09,163
Put yourself here.

524
00:41:12,277 --> 00:41:13,455
We have quail today--

525
00:41:13,653 --> 00:41:16,271
No, grilled fish.
I don't have much time.

526
00:41:16,469 --> 00:41:17,614
-Turbot?
-Perfect.

527
00:41:17,813 --> 00:41:19,307
-And for you, sir?
-The same.

528
00:41:19,509 --> 00:41:22,356
You don't mind turbot?
Turbot all around.

529
00:41:35,797 --> 00:41:36,942
I invited him.

530
00:41:37,557 --> 00:41:39,629
You lived it up in the provinces!

531
00:41:40,853 --> 00:41:42,063
What did you tell him?

532
00:41:42,261 --> 00:41:43,308
Don't worry!

533
00:41:43,509 --> 00:41:45,614
He's almost as discreet as you.

534
00:41:45,813 --> 00:41:47,023
For you, miss?

535
00:41:47,221 --> 00:41:49,228
You knew her father, the hero?

536
00:41:49,429 --> 00:41:51,982
She talks about him. Don't you?

537
00:41:53,109 --> 00:41:54,254
Your father.

538
00:41:54,453 --> 00:41:58,195
Enlisted in 1 91 4, wounded twice,
escaped three times.

539
00:41:58,389 --> 00:42:00,593
He'd be surprised to see her here.

540
00:42:00,788 --> 00:42:03,177
-Why?
-The atmosphere.

541
00:42:05,109 --> 00:42:06,483
What does that mean?

542
00:42:11,413 --> 00:42:13,322
Excuse me, I think someone....

543
00:42:15,349 --> 00:42:16,723
She's looking for me.

544
00:42:21,013 --> 00:42:22,322
What's the matter?

545
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:26,635
The professor needs to speak
to your friend, the minister.

546
00:42:26,837 --> 00:42:28,593
-He's not my friend.
-Oh, come on!

547
00:42:28,789 --> 00:42:31,123
You even know the government.

548
00:42:31,317 --> 00:42:32,244
No, I don't.

549
00:42:32,437 --> 00:42:34,858
You have to help us. No one else can.

550
00:42:45,269 --> 00:42:46,381
Sorry.

551
00:43:21,589 --> 00:43:23,279
My secretary.

552
00:43:23,477 --> 00:43:24,819
-Sit down.
-I'm all right.

553
00:43:25,012 --> 00:43:27,379
Take my place, I'm leaving.

554
00:43:27,573 --> 00:43:28,915
-You are?
-Good luck.

555
00:43:34,101 --> 00:43:35,246
Are you friends?

556
00:43:35,445 --> 00:43:36,721
No, not at all.

557
00:43:36,917 --> 00:43:38,324
Your turbot, miss.

558
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:45,387
Mr. Auger?

559
00:43:46,101 --> 00:43:49,232
You are Frédéric Auger?
I'm André Arpel's nephew.

560
00:43:49,429 --> 00:43:51,217
Does André Arpel ring a bell?

561
00:43:51,413 --> 00:43:53,868
You were found with his body...

562
00:43:54,068 --> 00:43:56,589
...in the trunk of his car.
Aren't you in jail?

563
00:43:56,789 --> 00:43:57,902
Get off my back!

564
00:43:59,701 --> 00:44:01,228
Help! He's a criminal!

565
00:44:10,996 --> 00:44:12,851
He killed my uncle!

566
00:44:31,412 --> 00:44:32,787
Murderer!

567
00:44:56,149 --> 00:44:57,709
I'm all right!

568
00:45:08,948 --> 00:45:09,930
Viviane, wait!

569
00:45:10,133 --> 00:45:12,271
Professor, give me a few hours.

570
00:45:12,469 --> 00:45:14,192
-It sails tonight.
-We have time.

571
00:45:14,389 --> 00:45:17,291
I need to speak to my colleagues.
Don't worry.

572
00:45:17,492 --> 00:45:20,045
Brémond, my secretary,
will stay with you.

573
00:45:48,308 --> 00:45:49,835
Marseilles called--

574
00:45:50,036 --> 00:45:51,182
Please!

575
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,187
Your little neighbor!

576
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,682
Bravo! A killer!

577
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:59,981
And I eat with him!

578
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:02,319
With France's future at stake!

579
00:46:03,893 --> 00:46:05,453
It's outrageous!

580
00:46:05,653 --> 00:46:06,580
I didn't know.

581
00:46:06,773 --> 00:46:09,194
-That he killed Arpel?
-That he was here.

582
00:46:09,397 --> 00:46:12,146
-You didn't know about Arpel?
-No, I thought--

583
00:46:12,341 --> 00:46:15,341
You knew, and you hid it from me!

584
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,711
Cut the lies, Viviane!

585
00:46:20,181 --> 00:46:21,075
What?

586
00:46:21,781 --> 00:46:22,861
The car's downstairs.

587
00:46:23,061 --> 00:46:24,403
Send it up!

588
00:46:24,788 --> 00:46:27,822
No, tell the driver
to come up for the files.

589
00:46:35,477 --> 00:46:37,681
How can I possibly trust you?

590
00:46:37,876 --> 00:46:40,527
If only you'd tell me the truth.

591
00:46:40,725 --> 00:46:42,034
Just once.

592
00:46:42,228 --> 00:46:45,043
I'm sure he did it for me,
to protect me.

593
00:46:45,908 --> 00:46:49,836
He probably went to see Arpel,
and they must have fought.

594
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,458
He won't let anyone hurt me.

595
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:56,300
Has he killed other men?

596
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:02,192
He used to box critics
who gave me bad reviews.

597
00:47:03,956 --> 00:47:06,258
He got beaten up once too.

598
00:47:06,453 --> 00:47:09,486
Very touching,
but this is no time for tears.

599
00:47:11,732 --> 00:47:13,074
Where is he staying?

600
00:47:13,269 --> 00:47:14,381
I have no idea.

601
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:16,882
I'll get the police to find him.

602
00:47:26,453 --> 00:47:28,307
-Did you find her?
-Who?

603
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:29,198
Her!

604
00:47:29,876 --> 00:47:32,844
Maurice, let me introduce you.
This is Auger.

605
00:47:35,861 --> 00:47:37,716
-You didn't find her?
-I did.

606
00:47:37,908 --> 00:47:40,461
Can you get her autograph next time?

607
00:47:41,429 --> 00:47:44,745
Not for me, for Maurice.
He's wild about actresses.

608
00:47:44,949 --> 00:47:48,047
-What have you told him?
-You can trust him.

609
00:47:53,493 --> 00:47:55,435
Was her minister there?

610
00:47:55,636 --> 00:47:57,524
Is he going to give her back?

611
00:47:58,772 --> 00:48:02,067
No? I admire you!
I'd have settled it by now.

612
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:05,392
-You know, stars are special--
-Shut your mouth.

613
00:48:06,196 --> 00:48:08,684
Don't give up! You've got the looks!

614
00:48:39,061 --> 00:48:41,395
Is the whole stock here?

615
00:48:42,293 --> 00:48:43,220
Is it safe?

616
00:48:43,413 --> 00:48:44,842
How do you mean?

617
00:48:45,716 --> 00:48:47,145
It won't explode?

618
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:51,529
It's no use at all in this state.
You need uranium.

619
00:48:51,732 --> 00:48:55,278
And you can't get anywhere
without heavy water.

620
00:48:57,236 --> 00:49:00,814
It slows the neutrons
and creates the chain reaction.

621
00:49:01,012 --> 00:49:02,419
A chain reaction?

622
00:49:02,613 --> 00:49:03,409
Mr. Girard.

623
00:49:04,021 --> 00:49:04,948
Sorry.

624
00:49:08,212 --> 00:49:11,027
Be there at 5.
The place is a school.

625
00:49:11,476 --> 00:49:14,159
Find a garage.
You can't leave the car here.

626
00:49:14,356 --> 00:49:16,243
Mr. Girard's guarding it.

627
00:49:16,436 --> 00:49:19,753
The city's teeming with spies.
I'll send you someone.

628
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:22,804
Make yourself useful
and speed things up!

629
00:49:22,996 --> 00:49:25,385
It can't take long to draft an order.

630
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:27,083
Shall I do a rough copy?

631
00:49:37,012 --> 00:49:38,955
"Issued in Paris...."

632
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:40,654
Excuse me, but....

633
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:42,675
Do you need it back?

634
00:49:42,868 --> 00:49:45,902
We're sorry.
It's for our visas for Portugal.

635
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:47,627
My pages.

636
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,264
They're just here.

637
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,343
I put them here.

638
00:49:52,629 --> 00:49:53,676
Father!

639
00:49:55,477 --> 00:49:56,819
No! It's interesting!

640
00:49:57,012 --> 00:49:58,954
It belongs to this gentleman!

641
00:49:59,157 --> 00:50:02,506
Sorry! You're the--
Forgive me, I took the liberty.

642
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:03,918
A novel, isn't it?

643
00:50:04,117 --> 00:50:06,986
-I hope so.
-It needs work, but it's all there.

644
00:50:07,189 --> 00:50:08,563
May I make some remarks?

645
00:50:08,757 --> 00:50:10,644
They could help this young man!

646
00:50:10,837 --> 00:50:12,266
You use vague words.

647
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:15,534
For instance,
"One could hear the audience."

648
00:50:15,733 --> 00:50:18,318
Who is "one"? You?
Someone passing by?

649
00:50:18,517 --> 00:50:19,727
I'll bear it in mind.

650
00:50:19,925 --> 00:50:21,834
"One" isn't anybody, you see?

651
00:50:54,389 --> 00:50:55,665
Going somewhere?

652
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:56,787
Shopping.

653
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:59,795
-You left the hotel alone.
-And you followed me?

654
00:51:00,757 --> 00:51:02,644
Really! Am I like that?

655
00:51:02,836 --> 00:51:05,105
Can I drop you off somewhere?

656
00:51:05,301 --> 00:51:06,675
I have my car here.

657
00:51:06,869 --> 00:51:09,007
-There's no need.
-Be reasonable.

658
00:51:09,204 --> 00:51:11,986
All these refugees.
It's not safe for you.

659
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:14,067
-I'll get the car.
-Don't!

660
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:16,715
Why not? Are you scared of me?

661
00:51:17,652 --> 00:51:18,699
You avoid me.

662
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,460
It's not that, but....

663
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:23,050
You have problems, I know.

664
00:51:23,252 --> 00:51:26,351
I could help if you didn't
keep spurning me.

665
00:51:26,548 --> 00:51:29,298
That boy, for instance. Frédéric.

666
00:51:29,493 --> 00:51:33,267
If he talks, you've had it.
Shall I see to him?

667
00:51:51,029 --> 00:51:52,785
There's a lady here for you.

668
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:55,631
I gave her some water.
She feels faint.

669
00:52:00,692 --> 00:52:02,601
Come on, don't stay here.

670
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:09,072
Everyone saw me with you!
The whole city knows now!

671
00:52:09,269 --> 00:52:12,018
-Calm down.
-They know! I'm finished.

672
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,514
I've brought your typewriter back.

673
00:52:15,989 --> 00:52:17,876
I'm so angry at Granddad.

674
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:18,700
It's okay.

675
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:22,064
He liked your book.
He'd love to read the rest.

676
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:26,669
My head's spinning.

677
00:52:30,708 --> 00:52:31,788
Can I help?

678
00:52:36,757 --> 00:52:38,961
Here, take it. But I want it back!

679
00:52:39,989 --> 00:52:42,225
He'll be so-- My grandfather is--

680
00:52:52,117 --> 00:52:53,393
Are you all right?

681
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:59,854
Some of us want to fight,
but others don't!

682
00:54:00,052 --> 00:54:04,013
We're all French here!
Spare me your lectures!

683
00:54:04,213 --> 00:54:06,547
-Our duty is to leave!
-To go where?

684
00:54:06,741 --> 00:54:08,780
North Africa, Algiers, Tunis.

685
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,835
Go, then, and good luck to you!

686
00:54:11,028 --> 00:54:12,938
If you go, you'll go for good.

687
00:54:15,029 --> 00:54:16,206
Gentlemen!

688
00:54:17,748 --> 00:54:19,090
Please!

689
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:26,860
We must fight the invader.
With our allies.

690
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:29,994
National legitimacy is on our side!

691
00:54:30,196 --> 00:54:34,058
If you abandon the French to their fate,
they won't forget.

692
00:54:38,292 --> 00:54:41,107
You'll be deserters,
emigrants, traitors!

693
00:54:41,301 --> 00:54:42,228
Treason!

694
00:54:42,772 --> 00:54:46,317
The traitors are those
who leave to save our homeland...

695
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:49,647
...or who stay to bargain
with the enemy.

696
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:56,304
Professor Kopolski? Excuse me.

697
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:59,759
You may not remember me.
Alex Winckler.

698
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:04,075
I interviewed you in Geneva,
after that conference.

699
00:55:04,276 --> 00:55:06,316
Yes, that's right.

700
00:55:06,708 --> 00:55:08,596
Are you here for a few days?

701
00:55:09,108 --> 00:55:11,247
Don't worry, it's not for my paper.

702
00:55:13,237 --> 00:55:14,643
I'm prying.

703
00:55:15,316 --> 00:55:16,461
Forgive me.

704
00:55:19,957 --> 00:55:23,372
When it comes to war,
all that counts is the word...

705
00:55:23,572 --> 00:55:25,296
...of great military men.

706
00:55:25,492 --> 00:55:29,486
If Marshal Pétain tells us
to lay down our arms...

707
00:55:29,876 --> 00:55:32,112
...we have to surrender!

708
00:55:52,468 --> 00:55:53,962
Who's this with me?

709
00:55:54,165 --> 00:55:55,092
Your brother.

710
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:57,427
Antoine?

711
00:55:58,036 --> 00:56:00,938
That's our garden!
Where was this taken from?

712
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:02,285
My window.

713
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:05,037
I don't believe it!
You were spying on me!

714
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:06,512
You knew I was.

715
00:56:13,076 --> 00:56:16,654
You have to leave, Frédéric.
They'll soon find you here.

716
00:56:16,852 --> 00:56:18,859
-You have to leave too.
-I can't.

717
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:20,435
You're in danger now.

718
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:22,540
You said you were.

719
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:33,515
Come with me. We'll leave together.

720
00:56:34,772 --> 00:56:35,700
To go where?

721
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:38,161
I don't know. Far away.

722
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:41,264
Far away.

723
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:42,670
To Portugal.

724
00:56:43,188 --> 00:56:45,489
We can get visas.
Other people have.

725
00:56:46,772 --> 00:56:47,852
What will we do?

726
00:56:48,052 --> 00:56:50,474
We could move on
to South America.

727
00:56:50,676 --> 00:56:51,603
Mexico?

728
00:56:51,796 --> 00:56:53,073
Mexico if you want.

729
00:56:53,268 --> 00:56:54,894
They've offered me films.

730
00:56:55,092 --> 00:56:58,060
You see! lmagine the riot
if you turn up!

731
00:57:01,108 --> 00:57:02,537
What will you do?

732
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:05,740
I'll give classes,
I'll finish my book.

733
00:57:06,388 --> 00:57:09,388
Your book?
Don't tell me it's still the same one.

734
00:57:09,588 --> 00:57:10,516
It is.

735
00:57:12,308 --> 00:57:16,083
It's finished now!
I just need to tidy up a few loose ends.

736
00:57:16,628 --> 00:57:18,154
Did you see that publisher?

737
00:57:18,356 --> 00:57:19,021
Which one?

738
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:20,562
The one I found for you.

739
00:57:20,756 --> 00:57:21,684
He's a crook.

740
00:57:21,876 --> 00:57:22,804
Really?

741
00:57:25,876 --> 00:57:28,942
If you become famous,
I could publish your poems.

742
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:30,350
What poems?

743
00:57:30,548 --> 00:57:33,450
The ones you slipped
through my shutters.

744
00:57:33,652 --> 00:57:34,961
You've forgotten?

745
00:57:35,156 --> 00:57:36,138
You kept them?

746
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:37,649
Of course.

747
00:58:24,852 --> 00:58:28,147
I'm going to disappoint you,
but try to understand.

748
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:32,530
My colleagues and I can't let you
take the heavy water to England.

749
00:58:32,724 --> 00:58:33,738
But you said--

750
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:37,769
I was wrong. It must stay here,
in the national interest.

751
00:58:37,971 --> 00:58:40,241
The Germans will take it to Germany.

752
00:58:40,436 --> 00:58:42,378
We'll put it in a safe place.

753
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:44,849
Everyone knows
we have to negotiate.

754
00:58:45,044 --> 00:58:46,321
Within hours, even.

755
00:58:46,516 --> 00:58:49,101
-With the Germans?
-Not the Chinese!

756
00:58:49,588 --> 00:58:51,825
We can't compromise the truce.

757
00:58:52,948 --> 00:58:54,890
That's the cost of peace.

758
00:58:55,092 --> 00:58:56,041
Peace.

759
00:58:56,628 --> 00:58:58,832
It could be a bargaining chip for us.

760
00:58:59,028 --> 00:59:02,377
The heavy water
as a gesture of goodwill?

761
00:59:02,579 --> 00:59:05,263
I told you,
we'll put it in a safe place.

762
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:08,176
They'll find it. They're not idiots.

763
00:59:08,372 --> 00:59:09,517
Oh, please!

764
00:59:09,716 --> 00:59:11,690
What about the professor?

765
00:59:11,892 --> 00:59:14,739
Is a stateless Jew
part of the package?

766
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:20,467
Be quiet!

767
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:22,799
That's complicity with the enemy!

768
00:59:23,796 --> 00:59:25,007
Stand aside!

769
00:59:26,708 --> 00:59:28,017
Shame on you!

770
00:59:28,212 --> 00:59:30,186
You know what the Germans will do!

771
00:59:30,388 --> 00:59:32,592
They'll make a bomb!
An atom bomb!

772
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:01,707
They're confused.
They don't know what to do.

773
01:00:01,908 --> 01:00:04,657
Don't be so indulgent.
They know you're at risk.

774
01:00:04,852 --> 01:00:06,510
Yes, maybe.

775
01:00:06,708 --> 01:00:09,839
It's too late to bother
with people's motives now.

776
01:00:17,748 --> 01:00:18,697
Leave us alone.

777
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:21,715
Listen, I never expected it
to come to this.

778
01:00:22,132 --> 01:00:24,783
They're capitulating.
I'm ashamed too.

779
01:00:25,556 --> 01:00:26,701
About that boat--

780
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:28,788
It's too late now!

781
01:00:32,819 --> 01:00:34,575
-Where will you go?
-Bayonne.

782
01:00:34,772 --> 01:00:38,187
There are roadblocks.
Don't bring your car out.

783
01:00:38,388 --> 01:00:39,914
You found a garage?

784
01:00:40,116 --> 01:00:41,523
It's in the street?

785
01:00:45,076 --> 01:00:46,123
What's wrong?

786
01:00:47,028 --> 01:00:48,850
It's going to be impounded.

787
01:01:11,219 --> 01:01:12,975
Hey, don't smash everything!

788
01:01:13,172 --> 01:01:14,350
Just looking.

789
01:01:17,652 --> 01:01:19,277
-What is it?
-Pichon-Longueville.

790
01:01:19,476 --> 01:01:20,970
-What vintage?
-'28.

791
01:01:21,171 --> 01:01:22,480
Wow!

792
01:01:22,676 --> 01:01:23,603
Let me see!

793
01:01:27,668 --> 01:01:29,293
Who'll buy that now?

794
01:01:29,492 --> 01:01:31,597
You're crazy! We hold on to it.

795
01:01:31,796 --> 01:01:34,381
If the war lasts,
we'll be rolling in it!

796
01:01:58,196 --> 01:02:00,432
What are you doing? Raoul!

797
01:02:02,515 --> 01:02:03,977
Come over here.

798
01:02:07,315 --> 01:02:08,264
I'll fetch her.

799
01:02:08,467 --> 01:02:09,711
No, I'm all right.

800
01:02:09,908 --> 01:02:11,817
-Where are you going?
-Stay here.

801
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:13,743
-Who is he?
-A scientist.

802
01:02:16,468 --> 01:02:18,028
Excuse me.

803
01:02:18,227 --> 01:02:20,683
Can you see my hat anywhere?

804
01:02:38,612 --> 01:02:39,986
It's broken down.

805
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:41,424
That's right.

806
01:02:41,619 --> 01:02:42,961
We can't move it.

807
01:02:43,156 --> 01:02:44,366
That's enough, miss.

808
01:03:01,267 --> 01:03:04,496
No! That's second gear!
You'll stall it!

809
01:03:04,692 --> 01:03:06,252
First gear's at the top.

810
01:03:06,452 --> 01:03:07,946
You'll stall it!

811
01:03:21,171 --> 01:03:22,513
What's going on?

812
01:03:31,987 --> 01:03:34,224
Professor Kopolski,
Collège de France.

813
01:03:34,419 --> 01:03:36,754
Where are you taking my car?

814
01:03:36,947 --> 01:03:37,875
To police HQ.

815
01:03:38,068 --> 01:03:40,304
Let me see a written order.

816
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:48,300
Stop! You'll wreck the gears!

817
01:04:22,388 --> 01:04:24,210
They've lost them.

818
01:04:31,188 --> 01:04:33,043
We have to let Berlin know.

819
01:04:55,028 --> 01:04:56,140
You're in physics?

820
01:04:58,547 --> 01:04:59,856
I'd have liked that.

821
01:05:00,051 --> 01:05:03,400
Those little tubes, the bubbles,
water turning red....

822
01:05:03,603 --> 01:05:05,513
That's more like chemistry.

823
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:07,310
It's not the same?

824
01:05:07,508 --> 01:05:08,522
Here they come!

825
01:05:21,331 --> 01:05:22,280
My friends!

826
01:05:25,492 --> 01:05:28,394
Are you all right, Camille?
You're not hurt?

827
01:05:28,596 --> 01:05:29,905
No, I'm all right.

828
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:31,594
You too, Mr. Girard?

829
01:05:31,795 --> 01:05:33,519
No, look what he's done!

830
01:05:33,715 --> 01:05:35,570
Who's going to mend this?

831
01:05:37,876 --> 01:05:38,824
Auger!

832
01:05:39,411 --> 01:05:40,621
Time to go, Raoul.

833
01:05:40,820 --> 01:05:42,162
Just a second!

834
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:43,918
Madame Arbesault!

835
01:05:44,115 --> 01:05:45,642
Can you send my pal down?

836
01:05:45,843 --> 01:05:46,792
He went out.

837
01:05:46,995 --> 01:05:47,922
For long?

838
01:05:48,115 --> 01:05:50,025
I don't know. He was with a lady.

839
01:05:50,227 --> 01:05:51,154
An actress?

840
01:05:51,347 --> 01:05:53,038
I think so.

841
01:05:54,035 --> 01:05:54,963
He's here too?

842
01:05:55,156 --> 01:05:56,912
Auger? Yes, we stick together.

843
01:05:57,107 --> 01:05:58,798
Guess who was here!

844
01:05:58,996 --> 01:06:00,654
-Who?
-Her! Auger's girl!

845
01:06:00,851 --> 01:06:01,647
No kidding!

846
01:06:01,844 --> 01:06:04,080
His ex. She's with a minister now.

847
01:06:04,275 --> 01:06:07,439
I know. They were having
lunch together earlier.

848
01:06:07,636 --> 01:06:09,042
All three of them?

849
01:06:09,747 --> 01:06:11,308
Would you believe it!

850
01:06:11,859 --> 01:06:14,859
Poor Auger,
she's pulling his strings.

851
01:06:15,059 --> 01:06:16,685
She has been for years.

852
01:06:18,739 --> 01:06:21,554
Did he tell you
how he was almost arrested?

853
01:06:21,748 --> 01:06:22,675
He was?

854
01:06:22,867 --> 01:06:24,176
You knew he was in jail?

855
01:06:24,372 --> 01:06:28,365
And escaped? Sure, I was with him.
Lucky for him I was!

856
01:06:30,068 --> 01:06:32,817
That's how it goes. We're outlaws.

857
01:06:33,012 --> 01:06:34,419
So are you now.

858
01:06:34,611 --> 01:06:36,335
Mr. Girard and the professor too.

859
01:06:36,531 --> 01:06:38,637
It's best to stick together.

860
01:06:38,835 --> 01:06:41,421
It'll make it easier for the police.

861
01:06:42,675 --> 01:06:43,984
I'll be back later.

862
01:06:44,499 --> 01:06:46,060
We'll have dinner, okay?

863
01:06:54,867 --> 01:06:57,737
The consulate opens at 8.
I'll be there.

864
01:06:57,939 --> 01:07:01,168
I know who did their visas.
He can help me.

865
01:07:01,364 --> 01:07:02,793
I'll call you after.

866
01:07:08,147 --> 01:07:10,569
I'd best keep away from the hotel.

867
01:07:10,771 --> 01:07:12,265
Fetch me your passport.

868
01:07:12,851 --> 01:07:14,477
You want me to come?

869
01:07:14,675 --> 01:07:15,603
What is it?

870
01:07:15,795 --> 01:07:19,057
I can't leave. You know I can't.
We're dreaming.

871
01:07:19,251 --> 01:07:21,390
-I can't leave.
-You have no choice.

872
01:07:21,587 --> 01:07:23,016
You forget whom I live with.

873
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:27,598
-You're counting on him?
-He'll protect me.

874
01:07:27,795 --> 01:07:30,577
You must go, though!
You can't live in hiding.

875
01:07:30,771 --> 01:07:34,033
Wire me from Lisbon.
Don't sign, I'll know it's you.

876
01:07:34,227 --> 01:07:36,016
Do you have money?

877
01:07:36,212 --> 01:07:38,830
I'll fetch some.
Where are you going?

878
01:07:42,771 --> 01:07:43,720
Leave me be!

879
01:07:45,012 --> 01:07:46,702
Is it because of Jean-Etienne?

880
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:51,373
Forget him.
You'll dump him after using him...

881
01:07:51,572 --> 01:07:53,579
...like every other man in your life!

882
01:07:53,779 --> 01:07:56,114
You don't even love yourself.

883
01:07:56,307 --> 01:07:58,195
You'll end up alone with your mirror!

884
01:09:15,027 --> 01:09:16,107
Miss Denvert!

885
01:09:18,996 --> 01:09:20,337
I'm Thierry Arpel.

886
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:23,498
Sorry about that fuss earlier.
I had no choice.

887
01:09:23,699 --> 01:09:27,114
Weren't you surprised
to see Frédéric Auger here?

888
01:09:27,315 --> 01:09:30,315
-Everyone's here.
-But he should be in jail.

889
01:09:30,516 --> 01:09:32,304
-So I heard.
-You heard?

890
01:09:32,691 --> 01:09:34,185
I don't have time now.

891
01:09:37,651 --> 01:09:38,993
Is Mr. Beaufort here?

892
01:09:39,539 --> 01:09:41,928
-He's at the prefecture.
-Again? Why?

893
01:09:42,132 --> 01:09:43,473
The premier resigned.

894
01:09:43,667 --> 01:09:45,293
Who's replacing him?

895
01:09:45,491 --> 01:09:47,280
Marshal Pétain.

896
01:09:48,371 --> 01:09:50,193
-What's happening?
-An air raid.

897
01:09:53,235 --> 01:09:56,137
My uncle's love of actresses
killed him!

898
01:09:56,339 --> 01:09:57,266
Leave me alone.

899
01:09:57,459 --> 01:09:59,314
What a beautiful way to die!

900
01:09:59,507 --> 01:10:02,639
I wouldn't mind it either.
I love actresses too.

901
01:10:02,835 --> 01:10:04,624
Dying in a star's arms....

902
01:10:05,587 --> 01:10:07,889
My uncle's mistress....
Why not mine?

903
01:10:20,851 --> 01:10:21,866
Excuse me.

904
01:10:22,067 --> 01:10:25,896
I'm looking for a friend
who might be staying here.

905
01:10:26,099 --> 01:10:28,881
His name's Kopolski,
Professor Kopolski.

906
01:10:30,036 --> 01:10:33,232
He's with a young woman,
a brunette, 25--

907
01:10:39,636 --> 01:10:40,563
Let go!

908
01:10:40,755 --> 01:10:43,755
How did he seduce you all?
Aren't I just as good?

909
01:10:44,275 --> 01:10:45,486
Do you mind!

910
01:10:53,172 --> 01:10:55,441
Thank you, Alex!
What a horrible man!

911
01:10:55,635 --> 01:10:56,563
Who is he?

912
01:10:56,755 --> 01:10:58,959
Some maniac who's obsessed
with me.

913
01:10:59,155 --> 01:11:01,326
Don't worry, we'll see to him.

914
01:11:03,795 --> 01:11:05,005
He'll stay away now.

915
01:11:05,651 --> 01:11:06,699
Coming back?

916
01:11:09,651 --> 01:11:11,244
I'll wait for you!

917
01:12:01,715 --> 01:12:02,664
You're here?

918
01:12:02,867 --> 01:12:05,485
It was your friend Raoul who--

919
01:12:05,684 --> 01:12:06,861
Who what?

920
01:12:07,059 --> 01:12:10,092
Who saved our hides. So to speak.
You were no use.

921
01:12:10,291 --> 01:12:11,218
What?

922
01:12:11,411 --> 01:12:12,426
You said you'd help.

923
01:12:12,627 --> 01:12:15,474
That minister of yours
was supposed to help...

924
01:12:15,667 --> 01:12:18,220
...but we almost got arrested
and had to run...

925
01:12:18,419 --> 01:12:21,714
...like common crooks!
All because of you, thanks a lot!

926
01:12:29,076 --> 01:12:30,985
What can I say? I'm devastated.

927
01:12:31,187 --> 01:12:32,365
It's all my fault!

928
01:12:32,564 --> 01:12:35,793
Why did I listen to you?
That bastard!

929
01:12:35,987 --> 01:12:37,002
What bastard?

930
01:12:37,203 --> 01:12:38,632
Beaufort!

931
01:12:38,835 --> 01:12:41,901
I should've refused!
Now you're mad at me.

932
01:12:42,099 --> 01:12:43,790
-I can tell.
-You couldn't know.

933
01:12:43,987 --> 01:12:46,191
It was obvious. Look at his career.

934
01:12:46,675 --> 01:12:48,911
He changes sides all the time.

935
01:12:49,107 --> 01:12:52,685
I ask him to help you,
and he sends the police!

936
01:13:04,435 --> 01:13:05,712
What can you do now?

937
01:13:05,907 --> 01:13:06,922
I don't know.

938
01:13:08,147 --> 01:13:09,423
You can't give up!

939
01:13:09,619 --> 01:13:11,528
The professor needs to rest.

940
01:13:11,731 --> 01:13:14,120
-Not forever!
-Don't say that!

941
01:13:14,579 --> 01:13:15,659
I'm sorry.

942
01:13:19,187 --> 01:13:20,681
He still wants to leave?

943
01:13:22,451 --> 01:13:24,971
There must be a way.
Shall I see to it?

944
01:13:25,171 --> 01:13:27,821
-No, thank you.
-Let me! I know I can.

945
01:13:28,019 --> 01:13:29,229
There's no need.

946
01:13:29,427 --> 01:13:33,039
See, you are mad at me.
You don't trust me now!

947
01:13:33,811 --> 01:13:35,185
You've lied a lot.

948
01:13:35,379 --> 01:13:37,037
-When?
-All the time.

949
01:13:37,235 --> 01:13:38,861
Starting on the train.

950
01:13:39,059 --> 01:13:41,328
Should I have said I was in jail?

951
01:13:42,451 --> 01:13:44,109
I always prefer the truth.

952
01:13:44,307 --> 01:13:45,868
What do you want to know?

953
01:13:46,067 --> 01:13:47,561
Nothing. Not now.

954
01:13:48,467 --> 01:13:50,834
You call me a liar. Let me explain.

955
01:13:51,027 --> 01:13:54,376
All right, but later. My head aches.
You keep shouting.

956
01:13:54,579 --> 01:13:56,367
I don't like liars or drunks.

957
01:13:56,563 --> 01:13:58,832
Nor crooks?
They said I killed a man?

958
01:13:59,987 --> 01:14:00,969
You believed it?

959
01:14:01,171 --> 01:14:02,186
Well, you were in jail!

960
01:14:03,891 --> 01:14:04,938
That's too easy!

961
01:14:05,139 --> 01:14:07,146
Let me tell you the whole story.

962
01:14:07,795 --> 01:14:10,217
Should I try calling Bayonne?

963
01:14:10,419 --> 01:14:11,913
Sure, call Bayonne!

964
01:14:12,499 --> 01:14:14,060
What's wrong with you?

965
01:14:29,971 --> 01:14:33,233
Marshal, your nomination
was applauded...

966
01:14:33,427 --> 01:14:36,493
...by most of our embassies
on hearing the news.

967
01:14:36,691 --> 01:14:37,706
We have received...

968
01:14:37,907 --> 01:14:39,947
...telegrams of support.

969
01:14:52,211 --> 01:14:53,160
Excuse me.

970
01:14:57,139 --> 01:14:58,699
Are you totally witless?

971
01:14:58,899 --> 01:15:00,808
-I had to see you.
-Not now!

972
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:03,280
I had to. It's about Frédéric Auger.

973
01:15:03,475 --> 01:15:05,897
-What now?
-He didn't do anything.

974
01:15:06,099 --> 01:15:07,987
-Call the police off.
-Why?

975
01:15:08,179 --> 01:15:11,562
Because it was me. I killed Arpel.

976
01:15:33,747 --> 01:15:35,951
You really think I'm a killer?

977
01:15:46,931 --> 01:15:48,109
That woman.

978
01:15:49,587 --> 01:15:51,147
Is it all to do with her?

979
01:15:51,347 --> 01:15:52,329
What woman?

980
01:15:52,531 --> 01:15:53,873
You know who.

981
01:15:57,171 --> 01:15:59,080
You've known her for years.

982
01:16:00,434 --> 01:16:02,801
-Forever, even.
-Who said that?

983
01:16:02,995 --> 01:16:04,337
-Your friend.
-Raoul?

984
01:16:04,531 --> 01:16:06,952
What nerve! What has he told you?

985
01:16:07,154 --> 01:16:08,561
It's not a secret.

986
01:16:11,891 --> 01:16:13,898
-It can't be easy.
-What?

987
01:16:15,379 --> 01:16:17,103
Loving a woman like her.

988
01:16:19,219 --> 01:16:21,259
What about you?
Ever loved anyone?

989
01:16:23,539 --> 01:16:24,466
Who?

990
01:16:25,138 --> 01:16:26,186
That's my business.

991
01:16:26,387 --> 01:16:28,656
You won't answer my questions?

992
01:16:29,491 --> 01:16:31,727
-Not about myself.
-I noticed.

993
01:16:31,923 --> 01:16:33,745
-This young man--
-Which one?

994
01:16:33,939 --> 01:16:35,978
-The one you love.
-Says who?

995
01:16:36,851 --> 01:16:38,673
An older man, then.

996
01:16:39,347 --> 01:16:40,426
The professor!

997
01:16:40,627 --> 01:16:41,642
You're mad!

998
01:16:42,579 --> 01:16:44,586
Don't go. Forgive me. I'm stupid.

999
01:16:44,787 --> 01:16:46,675
Stay! I'll stop pestering you.

1000
01:16:56,275 --> 01:16:58,097
Why? Why tonight?

1001
01:16:58,290 --> 01:17:00,941
The night of decision. War or peace!

1002
01:17:01,139 --> 01:17:05,329
The world's eyes are on us,
and I'm caught up in a crime!

1003
01:17:05,523 --> 01:17:07,857
Not a crime!
It was self-defense!

1004
01:17:08,051 --> 01:17:09,611
People won't call it that!

1005
01:17:09,810 --> 01:17:10,759
No one knows!

1006
01:17:11,315 --> 01:17:14,097
Four people do!
You, me, Auger and young Arpel!

1007
01:17:14,291 --> 01:17:16,430
-Frédéric won't talk.
-Arpel could!

1008
01:17:16,626 --> 01:17:18,961
-Actually, I thought--
-What?

1009
01:17:19,154 --> 01:17:21,543
That you could have him arrested.

1010
01:17:21,747 --> 01:17:22,445
What for?

1011
01:17:22,642 --> 01:17:24,814
He's a sex maniac. Like his uncle!

1012
01:17:25,010 --> 01:17:26,385
You're insane!

1013
01:17:26,578 --> 01:17:28,105
As interior minister--

1014
01:17:28,307 --> 01:17:31,089
I should pervert justice?
You're raving mad!

1015
01:17:54,515 --> 01:17:55,725
Don't cry.

1016
01:17:57,139 --> 01:17:59,987
Don't cry.
Nothing will happen to you.

1017
01:18:01,459 --> 01:18:04,273
I'll close the case.
No one will suspect you.

1018
01:18:05,138 --> 01:18:06,032
And Frédéric?

1019
01:18:06,227 --> 01:18:07,154
Oh, really!

1020
01:18:11,667 --> 01:18:13,423
All right, I'll try.

1021
01:18:32,499 --> 01:18:33,928
May I?

1022
01:18:34,130 --> 01:18:35,058
Get Bayonne?

1023
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:37,617
Yes, but no one knows anything there.

1024
01:18:37,811 --> 01:18:40,178
-Why Bayonne?
-To find an English boat.

1025
01:18:40,371 --> 01:18:42,575
-Why go so far?
-There are none here.

1026
01:18:42,770 --> 01:18:44,199
No, but I'm sure that....

1027
01:18:45,298 --> 01:18:46,094
Hold on.

1028
01:18:46,291 --> 01:18:47,818
-What?
-Come on.

1029
01:18:56,755 --> 01:19:00,301
You see these serious faces?
France is vanquished...

1030
01:19:00,499 --> 01:19:03,761
...but perhaps she deserved it
for her laxity.

1031
01:19:03,954 --> 01:19:05,580
We must build a new France.

1032
01:19:05,779 --> 01:19:07,404
Is this your next speech?

1033
01:19:07,603 --> 01:19:09,228
Don't mock. I'm worried.

1034
01:19:09,843 --> 01:19:11,250
Worried about us.

1035
01:19:11,443 --> 01:19:13,385
We're moving toward a new age...

1036
01:19:13,587 --> 01:19:17,067
...and I fear it won't suit you.
There have been hints.

1037
01:19:17,267 --> 01:19:19,056
Hints about what?

1038
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:20,843
You can guess.

1039
01:19:21,555 --> 01:19:23,562
People disapprove of our affair.

1040
01:19:23,954 --> 01:19:25,864
It will become impossible.

1041
01:19:26,067 --> 01:19:28,140
It tears me apart to say it.

1042
01:19:30,578 --> 01:19:32,717
I'll never forget our happy times.

1043
01:19:39,314 --> 01:19:40,525
Minister.

1044
01:19:42,387 --> 01:19:43,664
They're waiting.

1045
01:19:45,395 --> 01:19:46,638
I'm coming.

1046
01:20:10,290 --> 01:20:11,239
The English?

1047
01:20:11,443 --> 01:20:13,516
They just left, round the corner.

1048
01:20:32,626 --> 01:20:33,706
Mr. Brémond!

1049
01:20:34,386 --> 01:20:35,793
Can you give me a lift?

1050
01:20:35,987 --> 01:20:37,929
-Actually, I have to--
-It's not far.

1051
01:20:38,130 --> 01:20:40,880
Please. Look at the state I'm in!

1052
01:20:47,699 --> 01:20:50,186
We called the airfield again.

1053
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:52,242
Takeoff's at 7, general.

1054
01:20:53,107 --> 01:20:54,797
You'll reach London by noon.

1055
01:21:01,010 --> 01:21:02,701
Come on, Albert! I'm ready.

1056
01:21:02,898 --> 01:21:03,826
Any news?

1057
01:21:04,019 --> 01:21:05,742
The marshal has capitulated.

1058
01:21:05,939 --> 01:21:08,426
-Thank God. At last!
-Hear that?

1059
01:21:08,627 --> 01:21:10,056
The armistice.

1060
01:21:10,258 --> 01:21:13,193
-We'll soon be back in Paris!
-With the Germans.

1061
01:21:13,394 --> 01:21:14,539
We'll make do.

1062
01:21:14,739 --> 01:21:17,357
Make do without us.
We're off to Nice.

1063
01:21:37,106 --> 01:21:39,594
Darling, you'll catch your death!

1064
01:21:39,795 --> 01:21:41,649
-You're leaving tomorrow?
-No, now.

1065
01:21:41,842 --> 01:21:43,369
-Can you take me?
-To Nice?

1066
01:21:43,570 --> 01:21:46,702
You have a room for me there.
I can't stay here.

1067
01:21:46,898 --> 01:21:48,906
I'll have my bags sent down.

1068
01:21:49,107 --> 01:21:53,100
But the car's full. I have five cases,
plus a trunk on the roof.

1069
01:21:53,587 --> 01:21:56,620
Doesn't the government
have any drivers left?

1070
01:21:57,171 --> 01:21:58,381
Thanks a lot.

1071
01:22:06,354 --> 01:22:09,104
I totally approve. Let her manage.

1072
01:22:25,746 --> 01:22:27,502
See, I didn't break anything.

1073
01:22:27,699 --> 01:22:30,928
The reverse gear keeps jamming,
after your acrobatics!

1074
01:22:31,122 --> 01:22:32,945
The professor has to leave.

1075
01:22:33,138 --> 01:22:34,066
For where?

1076
01:22:34,259 --> 01:22:38,895
Soulac, at the end of the estuary.
He leaves at dawn to catch a boat.

1077
01:22:39,090 --> 01:22:41,097
-Is it far?
-Seventy miles.

1078
01:22:41,299 --> 01:22:42,509
You'll make it.

1079
01:22:42,707 --> 01:22:46,863
I can't go with them.
I'm waiting for Mother to call.

1080
01:22:47,059 --> 01:22:48,171
So who's driving?

1081
01:22:48,371 --> 01:22:49,712
Mr. Auger.

1082
01:22:57,426 --> 01:23:00,841
Le Taillan is here.
There's only one road.

1083
01:23:01,043 --> 01:23:04,304
From there,
follow the signs to Castelnau.

1084
01:23:04,498 --> 01:23:06,385
I can't turn my back on you!

1085
01:23:06,578 --> 01:23:10,506
After Castelnau, head for Lesparre,
through the forest.

1086
01:23:10,707 --> 01:23:14,504
At Saint-Vivien, make sure
you take the right road to Soulac.

1087
01:23:14,706 --> 01:23:15,655
All right.

1088
01:23:15,859 --> 01:23:17,746
Let me drive them.

1089
01:23:17,938 --> 01:23:20,589
-It's okay.
-Do you know how to drive?

1090
01:23:22,098 --> 01:23:25,033
Seventy miles in the dark,
for God's sake!

1091
01:23:25,234 --> 01:23:26,925
He'll wrap you around a tree.

1092
01:23:27,890 --> 01:23:31,370
Do you even have the right papers
for the boat?

1093
01:23:31,571 --> 01:23:33,513
It's English, not French.

1094
01:23:34,451 --> 01:23:36,589
-Time to go.
-I'm ready.

1095
01:23:42,354 --> 01:23:44,143
Children, come here!

1096
01:23:50,355 --> 01:23:51,915
Camille, my briefcase!

1097
01:23:52,114 --> 01:23:53,805
-Where?
-In the hallway.

1098
01:23:56,306 --> 01:23:59,405
You'd have left
without saying goodbye? I'm hurt.

1099
01:23:59,603 --> 01:24:01,195
Weren't we having dinner?

1100
01:24:02,866 --> 01:24:04,273
I brought this.

1101
01:24:04,786 --> 01:24:05,833
Pauillac.

1102
01:24:07,539 --> 01:24:09,164
Thanks, but....

1103
01:24:21,170 --> 01:24:23,821
Let me take them.
I'm not asking much.

1104
01:24:24,019 --> 01:24:25,546
I saved the girl's life.

1105
01:24:25,746 --> 01:24:27,601
She's not even your type.

1106
01:24:27,794 --> 01:24:29,038
Get off my back!

1107
01:24:29,619 --> 01:24:32,815
Need them all, do you?
Where would you be without me?

1108
01:24:33,011 --> 01:24:34,320
Is that your truck?

1109
01:24:34,514 --> 01:24:36,075
You'll have to move it.

1110
01:24:45,650 --> 01:24:47,592
Lower! That's the heating!

1111
01:24:48,690 --> 01:24:51,145
You're leaving?
Here's your manuscript.

1112
01:24:51,666 --> 01:24:52,746
I made some notes.

1113
01:24:52,946 --> 01:24:55,848
I hope they're clear.
They're mostly about syntax.

1114
01:24:56,051 --> 01:24:57,458
It's a beautiful book.

1115
01:24:57,650 --> 01:25:00,999
Especially the last part.
The theater, the actress.

1116
01:25:01,203 --> 01:25:02,926
The woman trapped by her lies.

1117
01:25:03,123 --> 01:25:06,122
She's a fascinating character.
How can I put it?

1118
01:25:26,994 --> 01:25:29,383
This is absurd.
What's the big rush?

1119
01:25:29,586 --> 01:25:31,474
-What will you do in Nice?
-I told you.

1120
01:25:31,667 --> 01:25:35,147
It will all be over soon.
I can take you back to Paris.

1121
01:25:41,427 --> 01:25:42,736
Come on, come on.

1122
01:25:42,930 --> 01:25:44,076
Stop, perfect.

1123
01:25:50,898 --> 01:25:51,978
You're leaving?

1124
01:25:52,466 --> 01:25:54,408
-I'm going too.
-Where?

1125
01:25:54,611 --> 01:25:57,840
To stay with friends in Nice.
But their car's full.

1126
01:25:58,034 --> 01:25:59,823
And Alex has to work.

1127
01:26:02,130 --> 01:26:03,472
Could you take me?

1128
01:26:03,666 --> 01:26:04,648
To Nice?

1129
01:26:04,850 --> 01:26:06,257
It's out of your way?

1130
01:26:06,450 --> 01:26:07,977
Where are you going?

1131
01:26:08,178 --> 01:26:09,705
Perhaps I'm prying?

1132
01:26:09,906 --> 01:26:10,986
On holiday.

1133
01:26:11,187 --> 01:26:12,845
Really? Where?

1134
01:26:34,706 --> 01:26:38,503
Listen to me. I've left Jean-Etienne.
I told him everything.

1135
01:26:38,706 --> 01:26:41,423
I told him I did it. You're safe now.

1136
01:26:55,250 --> 01:26:57,803
Do you know where they're going?

1137
01:26:59,314 --> 01:27:01,169
To Soulac, to catch a boat.

1138
01:27:02,130 --> 01:27:05,643
Excuse me.
Is there a telephone here?

1139
01:27:05,842 --> 01:27:08,461
Don't leave me.
I don't know what to do.

1140
01:27:09,010 --> 01:27:11,760
I'm totally lost. Can't you see that?

1141
01:27:13,331 --> 01:27:15,273
I'm tired, Frédéric.

1142
01:27:35,698 --> 01:27:38,862
This will make your day.
You can drive them.

1143
01:27:39,794 --> 01:27:41,169
Whatever you say.

1144
01:27:48,178 --> 01:27:49,193
You're not coming?

1145
01:27:52,018 --> 01:27:53,807
She needs you, is that it?

1146
01:27:54,930 --> 01:27:58,159
Yes, I have to help her.
I have no choice.

1147
01:28:24,754 --> 01:28:25,736
Oh, sorry.

1148
01:28:25,938 --> 01:28:27,182
I won't be long.

1149
01:28:27,378 --> 01:28:30,444
I hope not.
This isn't the telephone exchange!

1150
01:28:35,346 --> 01:28:37,517
Mr. Girard!
Can you understand German?

1151
01:28:37,715 --> 01:28:38,642
A bit.

1152
01:28:38,834 --> 01:28:40,143
Come here!

1153
01:28:55,986 --> 01:28:58,572
You can write in the garden in Nice.

1154
01:28:58,770 --> 01:29:00,396
They have a big place.

1155
01:29:00,594 --> 01:29:04,009
They won't bother us.
A writer will make them look good.

1156
01:29:04,210 --> 01:29:05,901
-I won't be staying.
-Why?

1157
01:29:06,098 --> 01:29:08,749
Because it's over.
The house, the garden....

1158
01:29:08,946 --> 01:29:10,833
You don't believe it yourself.

1159
01:29:11,026 --> 01:29:12,270
I'll take you there.

1160
01:29:12,466 --> 01:29:14,474
That's the last thing I'll do for you.

1161
01:29:17,586 --> 01:29:19,015
You no longer love me.

1162
01:29:24,178 --> 01:29:25,520
It's my fault.

1163
01:29:26,706 --> 01:29:28,713
My dreams have ruined your life.

1164
01:29:28,914 --> 01:29:30,124
Mr. Auger!

1165
01:29:31,634 --> 01:29:33,008
Help!

1166
01:29:33,874 --> 01:29:35,597
Hurry! He'll kill him!

1167
01:29:35,794 --> 01:29:36,590
Who?

1168
01:29:36,786 --> 01:29:37,996
He's a spy!

1169
01:29:51,058 --> 01:29:51,985
Hold it!

1170
01:29:52,178 --> 01:29:54,066
You're not in Nice yet?

1171
01:30:27,890 --> 01:30:28,905
Who?

1172
01:30:29,394 --> 01:30:31,052
Yes, he's right here.

1173
01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:32,744
It's your mother.

1174
01:30:34,130 --> 01:30:35,307
Hello, Mother.

1175
01:30:35,954 --> 01:30:37,480
I'm all right.

1176
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:13,806
What's the book about?

1177
01:31:14,738 --> 01:31:16,112
Is it about her?

1178
01:31:16,626 --> 01:31:18,316
I'm just reading the notes.

1179
01:31:18,514 --> 01:31:20,237
You're being indiscreet.

1180
01:31:20,434 --> 01:31:21,994
It's interesting. Listen.

1181
01:31:22,194 --> 01:31:25,510
"These notes cannot disguise
one basic fact:

1182
01:31:25,714 --> 01:31:29,992
You're going to take your place
among the writers who matter.

1183
01:31:30,194 --> 01:31:31,885
There aren't that many."

1184
01:31:32,946 --> 01:31:34,287
How about that!

1185
01:31:48,210 --> 01:31:51,341
They know everything!
Soulac, the boat, the car.

1186
01:31:51,537 --> 01:31:53,196
Even the professor's name!

1187
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:03,505
What's going on?

1188
01:33:09,394 --> 01:33:10,190
The police!

1189
01:33:28,210 --> 01:33:29,103
Germans!

1190
01:35:24,946 --> 01:35:26,953
-Where are they?
-Over there. Come on.

1191
01:38:11,026 --> 01:38:12,367
Are you all right?

1192
01:38:29,393 --> 01:38:30,920
Camille, my dear...

1193
01:38:32,338 --> 01:38:33,417
...here we are.

1194
01:38:33,618 --> 01:38:35,527
We'll talk about this one day...

1195
01:38:35,730 --> 01:38:37,256
...I hope.

1196
01:38:49,809 --> 01:38:50,889
Why not come too?

1197
01:38:51,090 --> 01:38:53,064
What? You're going as well?

1198
01:38:54,994 --> 01:38:56,969
When did you decide that?

1199
01:38:57,169 --> 01:38:58,314
Just now.

1200
01:38:59,249 --> 01:39:02,511
I can't. It's impossible.
My life is here.

1201
01:39:03,409 --> 01:39:04,392
What life?

1202
01:39:06,450 --> 01:39:07,660
What will you do?

1203
01:39:07,858 --> 01:39:09,352
Whatever I can.

1204
01:39:14,578 --> 01:39:15,592
Goodbye, Camille.

1205
01:40:29,970 --> 01:40:31,017
Can you imagine...

1206
01:40:31,217 --> 01:40:34,032
...life in Nice?
With all those old ladies?

1207
01:40:34,226 --> 01:40:35,403
Honestly!

1208
01:40:35,986 --> 01:40:38,833
In Paris, things will soon
be back to normal.

1209
01:40:39,026 --> 01:40:39,974
You think so?

1210
01:40:40,178 --> 01:40:41,421
Of course!

1211
01:40:41,617 --> 01:40:43,144
Trust me.

1212
01:41:10,929 --> 01:41:12,206
Don't worry.

1213
01:42:01,074 --> 01:42:04,335
Paris, April 28, 1 942

1214
01:42:39,313 --> 01:42:40,491
Not here.

1215
01:42:40,690 --> 01:42:42,064
Read it later.

1216
01:42:42,737 --> 01:42:44,842
There's a note for Mr. Girard too.

1217
01:42:47,314 --> 01:42:49,518
-You saw him?
-The professor?

1218
01:42:49,713 --> 01:42:52,299
Last Monday, in Cambridge.
In his lab.

1219
01:42:56,017 --> 01:42:58,384
Is this your first time back?

1220
01:43:01,106 --> 01:43:02,447
Were you...?

1221
01:43:03,505 --> 01:43:05,066
Were you parachuted in?

1222
01:43:06,514 --> 01:43:07,790
Near Chartres?

1223
01:43:08,945 --> 01:43:10,123
How do you know?

1224
01:43:10,833 --> 01:43:12,622
I just know.

1225
01:43:12,817 --> 01:43:14,224
You're....

1226
01:43:18,097 --> 01:43:20,104
Are you staying long?

1227
01:43:20,306 --> 01:43:21,899
I have to go soon.

1228
01:43:24,657 --> 01:43:26,380
You've no time to write?

1229
01:43:26,577 --> 01:43:27,689
Not really.

1230
01:43:27,889 --> 01:43:28,871
Too bad.

1231
01:43:30,065 --> 01:43:31,494
I have your manuscript.

1232
01:43:31,697 --> 01:43:33,071
If you want, I could--

1233
01:43:33,809 --> 01:43:35,151
Don't turn round.

1234
01:43:45,169 --> 01:43:46,630
Sir! Just a second!

1235
01:43:46,834 --> 01:43:47,727
Miss!
