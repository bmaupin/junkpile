a bluebottle fly capable

landed on Rue St Vincent, Montmartre.

00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:59,260
At the same moment,
on a restaurant terrace nearby,

5
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:04,180
the wind magically made two glasses
dance unseen on a tablecloth.

6
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:11,060
Meanwhile, in a 5th-floor flat,
28 Avenue Trudaine, Paris 9,

7
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,900
returning from his best friend's funeral,
Eugène Colère erased his name

belonging to Raphaël Poulain,

00:01:28,999 --> 00:01:33,039
made a dash for an egg in his wife Amandine.

12
00:01:33,089 --> 00:01:35,169
Nine months later,

13
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:37,759
Amélie Poulain was born.

works at a spa in Enghien-Les-Bains.

18
00:03:29,735 --> 00:03:31,694
Raphaël Poulain dislikes:

19
00:03:32,744 --> 00:03:36,744
Peeing next to someone
else. He also dislikes:

20
00:03:36,784 --> 00:03:39,494
Catching scornful glances at his sandals.

21
00:03:43,084 --> 00:03:46,124
Clingy wet swimming trunks.

22
00:03:48,754 --> 00:03:50,844
Raphaël Poulain likes:

23
00:03:50,884 --> 00:03:53,134
Peeling off large strips of wallpaper.

24
00:03:56,134 --> 00:03:58,723
Lining up all his shoes and polishing them.

25
00:03:59,763 --> 00:04:01,973
Emptying his tool box,

26
00:04:02,023 --> 00:04:04,893
cleaning it out,

27
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:07,983
and putting everything back.

00:04:08,023 --> 00:04:12,153
Amélie's mother, Amandine,
a schoolmistress from Gueugnon,

29
00:04:12,193 --> 00:04:14,283
has always had shaky nerves.

Getting puckered fingers in the bath.

32
00:04:20,783 --> 00:04:23,832
When someone she doesn't like

33
00:04:23,872 --> 00:04:25,582
brushes against her hand.

34
00:04:27,122 --> 00:04:30,502
Pillow marks on her cheek in the morning.

00:04:38,342 --> 00:04:40,012
Emptying her handbag,

cleaning it out,

Amélie is six.

41
00:04:50,731 --> 00:04:54,151
Like all little girls,
she'd like to be hugged by her daddy.

42
00:04:55,191 --> 00:04:59,241
But he never touches her,
except for a monthly checkup.

43
00:04:59,281 --> 00:05:01,991
The thrill of this rare contact

44
00:05:02,031 --> 00:05:04,331
makes her heart beat like a drum.

45
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:05,911

Very good.

...hens fourth!
- No!

Deprived of playmates,

tossed about
between a neurotic and an iceberg,

59
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,190
Amélie retreats into her imagination.

In this world, LPs are made like pancakes.

Amélie has one friend, Blubber.

00:05:58,589 --> 00:06:03,339
Alas, the home environment
has made Blubber suicidal.

66
00:06:21,318 --> 00:06:25,448
Blubber's suicide attempts
destroy Mother's nerves.

67
00:06:25,488 --> 00:06:27,118
A decision is made.

68
00:06:27,158 --> 00:06:28,538
Enough!

69
00:07:02,446 --> 00:07:07,236
To comfort Amélie, her mother
gives her a second-hand Instamatic camera.

70
00:07:18,956 --> 00:07:21,506
Little girl! Look what you did!

71
00:07:21,546 --> 00:07:26,715
A neighbor fools her into thinking
her camera causes accidents.

72
00:07:26,755 --> 00:07:31,425
Because she'd been taking pictures
all afternoon, Amélie is petrified.

73
00:07:32,475 --> 00:07:35,475
She stares at the TV, racked by the guilt

74
00:07:35,515 --> 00:07:37,645
of causing a huge fire,

75
00:07:37,685 --> 00:07:39,605
two derailments

76
00:07:39,645 --> 00:07:41,525

A few days later,

00:07:45,395 --> 00:07:47,485
Amélie gets her revenge.

80
00:07:58,914 --> 00:08:01,204
What...?

00:08:29,063 --> 00:08:31,153
One day tragedy strikes.

82
00:08:31,193 --> 00:08:36,533
Amandine takes Amélie to Notre Dame to
light a candle and pray for a baby brother.

83
00:08:36,573 --> 00:08:38,953
Three minutes later, heaven sends,

84
00:08:38,993 --> 00:08:44,163
alas, not a baby boy, but Marguerite,
a tourist from Quebec,

85
00:08:44,203 --> 00:08:46,292
bent on ending her life.

86
00:08:48,922 --> 00:08:50,842
Amandine Poulain is killed instantly.

87
00:08:54,262 --> 00:08:59,142
After her mother's death,
Amélie lives alone with her father.

88
00:08:59,182 --> 00:09:03,222
His unsociable tendencies increase.

89
00:09:03,262 --> 00:09:06,732
He's obsessed with building
a miniature shrine

90
00:09:06,772 --> 00:09:08,982
to house his wife's ashes.

91
00:09:14,981 --> 00:09:17,611
Days, months and years go by.

92
00:09:22,491 --> 00:09:24,581
In such a dead world,

93
00:09:24,621 --> 00:09:28,291
Amélie prefers to dream
until she's old enough to leave home.

94
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:41,970
Five years later,
she's a waitress in Montmartre

95
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,180
at The Two Windmills.

96
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,140
It is August 29th.

97
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,900
In 48 hours, her life will change forever.

98
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:55,570
But she doesn't know it yet.

99
00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:00,280
She lives quietly among her colleagues
and the café's regulars.

100
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,820
That's Suzanne, the owner.

101
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,699
She limps a little but
she's never spilt a drink.

102
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:08,869
When she was younger, she was a circus rider.

103
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:11,499
She likes athletes who
cry with disappointment.

104
00:10:11,539 --> 00:10:16,549
She dislikes seeing men humiliated
in front of their kids in her café.

105
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:20,549
Georgette is the tobacconist.
She's a hypochondriac.

106
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:25,299
Migraines one day, sciatica the next.
She hates the words

107
00:10:25,349 --> 00:10:27,559
"fruit of thy womb".

108
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:31,768
Gina works with Amélie.
Her grandmother was a healer.

109
00:10:31,808 --> 00:10:34,808
She likes cracking bones.

110
00:10:34,858 --> 00:10:38,278
She's bringing a kir to
Hipolito, a failed writer.

111
00:10:38,318 --> 00:10:41,858
He likes seeing bullfighters gored on TV.

112
00:10:43,858 --> 00:10:48,408
Scowling at them is Joseph,
Gina's rejected lover.

113
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:51,038
He's always jealously spying on her.

114
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:52,828
All he likes

115
00:10:52,868 --> 00:10:55,837
is popping bubble wrap.

116
00:10:55,877 --> 00:10:58,337
And here's Philomène, an air hostess.

117
00:10:58,377 --> 00:11:02,377
Amélie looks after her cat Rodrigue
when she's away. Philomène likes

118
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:05,337
the sound of the cat's bowl on the tiles.

119
00:11:05,387 --> 00:11:09,347
Rodrigue likes overhearing
children's stories.

120
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:13,187
No, thanks, ma'am. I never work on Sundays.

121
00:11:14,227 --> 00:11:18,937
At weekends, Amélie often takes a train
from the Gare du Nord to see her father.

122
00:11:18,977 --> 00:11:22,946
- Why don't you use your retirement to...?
- To do what?

123
00:11:22,986 --> 00:11:25,066
Travel. You've never been away.

124
00:11:26,736 --> 00:11:30,656
When we were young,
your mother and I longed to travel.

125
00:11:32,116 --> 00:11:34,206
But we couldn't.

126
00:11:34,246 --> 00:11:37,246
- Because of your heart.
- Yes. I know.

127
00:11:37,286 --> 00:11:39,666
So now...

128
00:11:39,706 --> 00:11:41,546
Now...

129
00:11:41,586 --> 00:11:44,426
Some Friday evenings,
Amélie goes to the cinema.

130
00:11:44,506 --> 00:11:48,135
I like turning round
and looking at people's faces in the dark.

131
00:11:54,685 --> 00:11:58,515
I like noticing details
that no-one else ever sees.

132
00:12:01,105 --> 00:12:05,145
But I hate it in old American movies
when drivers don't watch the road.

133
00:12:10,655 --> 00:12:12,995
Amélie doesn't have a boyfriend.

134
00:12:13,075 --> 00:12:17,414
She tried once or twice,
but the results were a let-down.

135
00:12:17,494 --> 00:12:21,294
Instead, she cultivates a taste
for small pleasures.

136
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,834
Plunging her hand deep into a sack of grain.

137
00:12:24,914 --> 00:12:27,674
Cracking crème brûlée

138
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:29,714
with a teaspoon.

139
00:12:33,674 --> 00:12:36,344
And skimming stones on the Canal St Martin.

140
00:13:17,302 --> 00:13:20,222
They call him the Glass Man.

141
00:13:20,262 --> 00:13:23,012
He was born with bones as brittle as crystal.

142
00:13:24,062 --> 00:13:26,482
All his furniture is padded.

143
00:13:26,562 --> 00:13:29,902
A handshake would be enough
to crush his fingers.

144
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,061
He's stayed indoors for 20 years.

145
00:13:36,241 --> 00:13:38,281
Time has changed nothing.

146
00:13:38,361 --> 00:13:40,661
Amélie still takes refuge in solitude.

147
00:13:40,741 --> 00:13:45,371
She amuses herself with silly questions
about the world below,

148
00:13:45,451 --> 00:13:49,421
such as: "How many couples
are having an orgasm now?"

149
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,880
Fifteen.

150
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,850
Finally, on the night of August 30th 1997.

151
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:11,520
comes the event
that will change her life forever.

152
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,230
Lady Di, Princess of Wales,
died in a car crash in Paris last night

153
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:20,200
with her companion Dodi Al Fayed...

154
00:15:11,038 --> 00:15:14,708
Only the first man
to discover Tutankhamen's tomb

155
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:16,877
would understand how she felt

156
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:19,127
on finding this treasure

157
00:15:19,207 --> 00:15:23,047
hidden by a little boy 40 years ago.

158
00:15:28,557 --> 00:15:31,097
On August 31st at 4am,

159
00:15:31,177 --> 00:15:34,227
Amélie has a dazzling idea.

160
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:37,807
Wherever he was,
she would find the box's owner

161
00:15:37,857 --> 00:15:40,147
and give him back his treasure.

162
00:15:40,227 --> 00:15:44,986
If he was touched,
she'd become a regular do-gooder.

163
00:15:45,026 --> 00:15:47,026
If not, too bad.

164
00:15:53,956 --> 00:15:57,786
The girl from the 5th floor!
We don't see much of you.

165
00:15:57,826 --> 00:16:02,126
Would you know of a boy
who lived in my flat in the '50s?

166
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:04,416
A boy? Come and have a glass of port.

167
00:16:06,176 --> 00:16:09,005
- No, thanks.
- Come in! Close the door.

168
00:16:09,045 --> 00:16:13,175
Boys? I've known so many.

169
00:16:13,225 --> 00:16:17,515
They're cute until they discover
snowballs and chestnuts.

170
00:16:17,555 --> 00:16:19,645
I've known so many boys.

171
00:16:19,685 --> 00:16:23,235
- When did you come here?
- In '64.

172
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:26,025
You'll have heard the story.

173
00:16:26,065 --> 00:16:28,275
No, I don't think so.

174
00:16:28,315 --> 00:16:30,155
I'm amazed. Sit down.

175
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,864
My husband worked for Ladybird Insurance.

176
00:16:34,904 --> 00:16:38,374
It's no secret that he
slept with his secretary.

177
00:16:39,914 --> 00:16:42,374
They used every hotel around.

178
00:16:42,414 --> 00:16:44,124
Not the grotty ones, either.

179
00:16:44,164 --> 00:16:47,504
The bimbo liked spreading her legs,

180
00:16:47,544 --> 00:16:49,044
but only on satin.

181
00:16:49,084 --> 00:16:52,094
So my husband swiped from the till.

182
00:16:52,134 --> 00:16:55,174
A little at first, then 50 million.

183
00:16:55,224 --> 00:16:58,514
Off they flew to South America.

184
00:17:00,763 --> 00:17:01,813
Drink up.

185
00:17:03,853 --> 00:17:06,893
On January 20th 1970,

186
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,353
my doorbell rang.

187
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:14,483
"Your husband's been killed
in a car crash in South America."

188
00:17:15,573 --> 00:17:17,653
My life stopped there.

189
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,873
And Black Lion died of heartbreak.

190
00:17:20,913 --> 00:17:23,743
Poor creature.

191
00:17:26,293 --> 00:17:28,372
See how lovingly

192
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,462
he still stares at his master?

193
00:17:31,502 --> 00:17:32,542
One day

194
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:34,092
I'll read you his letters.

195
00:17:34,132 --> 00:17:35,882
No, don't go!

196
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:38,382
You can spare five minutes.

197
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,092
He wrote this

198
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,802
from the barracks.

199
00:17:44,392 --> 00:17:45,892
"Darling Mado." That's me.

200
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:47,602
I'm called Madeleine.

201
00:17:47,642 --> 00:17:50,652
"I can't sleep, can't eat,

202
00:17:50,692 --> 00:17:55,481
knowing that my only reason to live
is far away in Paris.

203
00:17:55,531 --> 00:17:57,941
I won't see her until a fortnight on Friday,

204
00:17:57,991 --> 00:18:03,781
when my sweet little weasel
appears at the station

205
00:18:03,831 --> 00:18:06,911
in her strappy blue dress."

206
00:18:06,951 --> 00:18:11,001
In brackets: "The one you think
is too transparent."

207
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,890
Has anyone ever written to you like that?

208
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:26,010
No. I'm nobody's little weasel.

209
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,640
My name's Madeleine Wells.

210
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,770
Madeleine, like Mary Magdalene.

211
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:35,320
She wept, right? And Wells as in water.

212
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,570
Talk about being born to cry!

213
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,990
About your question...

214
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:50,499
Ask Collignon, the grocer.
He's lived here all his life.

215
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:53,959
Hello, Amélie-mellow!

216
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:56,539
A fig and three hazelnuts, as usual?

217
00:18:56,589 --> 00:18:59,379
Who lived in my flat in the '50s?

218
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:03,429
- What was their name?
- You've got me there, dear.

219
00:19:03,469 --> 00:19:07,429
In 1950, I was two.
The mental age of this cretin.

220
00:19:07,469 --> 00:19:09,099
The "cretin" is Lucien.

221
00:19:09,139 --> 00:19:13,188
He's no genius, but Amélie likes him.
She likes the way

222
00:19:13,228 --> 00:19:16,558
he handles each endive like a precious object

223
00:19:16,608 --> 00:19:19,818
to be treated with care.
It's his way of showing

224
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:21,278
his love of good work.

225
00:19:21,318 --> 00:19:22,358
Look at him!

226
00:19:22,398 --> 00:19:26,868
Like he's nursing a baby bird
that's fallen out of its nest!

227
00:19:26,908 --> 00:19:29,578
Don't ask him for currants!

228
00:19:29,618 --> 00:19:31,248
You'd be here till Monday!

229
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,458
Get moving, spastic!

230
00:19:34,498 --> 00:19:36,538
She hasn't got all day.

231
00:19:39,377 --> 00:19:41,587
Here.

232
00:19:41,627 --> 00:19:45,337
Go and see my mother.
She has the memory of an elephant.

233
00:19:45,387 --> 00:19:47,547
Elephant Mum!

234
00:19:48,847 --> 00:19:50,347
Thank you.

235
00:20:08,826 --> 00:20:10,076
Bredoteau.

236
00:20:11,656 --> 00:20:12,696
Sorry?

237
00:20:12,746 --> 00:20:14,536
It's the name you're after.

238
00:20:14,576 --> 00:20:18,996
But if it's me that says so,
it won't count. I'm senile.

239
00:20:19,036 --> 00:20:20,996
Ignore him. He's senile.

240
00:20:22,046 --> 00:20:24,126
See what he's done to my laurel?

241
00:20:28,256 --> 00:20:30,925
His old job was punching métro tickets.

242
00:20:30,965 --> 00:20:36,185
For three months now,
he's got up every night to punch holes

243
00:20:36,225 --> 00:20:39,725
- in my laurels!
- I'd have preferred lilacs. Such is life!

244
00:20:39,765 --> 00:20:44,235
- We all need a way to relax.
- I skim stones.

245
00:20:44,275 --> 00:20:48,445
- You do?
- I'll find it. Don't worry.

246
00:20:48,485 --> 00:20:51,445
- I file everything.
- Like what?

247
00:20:51,485 --> 00:20:56,284
Your son's nearly 50
and I'm still doing his book-keeping.

248
00:20:56,324 --> 00:21:01,034
You were still squeezing his
toothpaste at 15, so it follows.

249
00:21:01,084 --> 00:21:03,454
Right. Camus...

250
00:21:03,504 --> 00:21:07,504
2nd floor on the right. Brossard...
Brossard was on staircase B.

251
00:21:07,544 --> 00:21:09,134
Got it!

252
00:21:09,174 --> 00:21:11,294
Bredoteau, 5th floor on the right.

253
00:21:11,344 --> 00:21:14,094
They were from the Pas de Calais.

254
00:21:14,134 --> 00:21:16,764
Bredoteau. What more can I say?

255
00:22:21,611 --> 00:22:25,201
Groping under the photo booth
is Nino Quincampoix.

256
00:22:29,661 --> 00:22:34,341
When Amélie lacked playmates,
Nino had too many.

257
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:50,560
Five miles apart, one dreamed
of having a sister, the other a brother

258
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,650
to spend all their time with.

259
00:23:14,289 --> 00:23:15,329
Hi, Dad.

260
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:18,339
A new friend?

261
00:23:19,379 --> 00:23:21,589
No, I've had him for years.

262
00:23:21,629 --> 00:23:25,549
Your mother hated him,
so he lived in the tool shed.

263
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:28,599
There. Let's reconcile them.

264
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:34,098
There. Not bad, eh?

265
00:23:37,978 --> 00:23:43,448
Dad, if you found a precious relic
from your childhood,

266
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:47,368
how would it make you feel?
Happy? Sad? Nostalgic? What?

267
00:23:48,448 --> 00:23:50,948
I didn't have this gnome when I was a child.

268
00:23:50,998 --> 00:23:54,618
He was a retirement gift
from my old regiment.

269
00:23:54,668 --> 00:23:59,127
No, I mean something you hid
like a secret treasure.

270
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:02,757
I should varnish him before autumn.

271
00:24:06,677 --> 00:24:09,307
I'll make some tea. Do you want some?

272
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:11,427
Breathe in. Hold still.

273
00:24:13,517 --> 00:24:15,227
Better now?

274
00:24:15,267 --> 00:24:17,147
Shut the door!

275
00:24:17,187 --> 00:24:19,227
There's a howling gale.

276
00:24:19,267 --> 00:24:21,277
It's hardly Siberia.

277
00:24:21,317 --> 00:24:23,897
I can see you're not allergic

278
00:24:23,947 --> 00:24:28,616
to car fumes.
I almost coughed up my pleura last night.

279
00:24:28,656 --> 00:24:30,156
Coughed up a pleura? Sure.

280
00:24:30,196 --> 00:24:33,786
- What's on the menu today, Suzanne?
- Endives au gratin.

281
00:24:33,826 --> 00:24:36,286
They'll have you on your knees, you'll see.

282
00:24:36,326 --> 00:24:37,536
They're good, then?

283
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,786
- Depends where.
- If it's at the toilet...

284
00:24:39,836 --> 00:24:41,126
Not good!

285
00:24:46,676 --> 00:24:50,635
12:15, laughs orgasmically
to attract alpha male.

286
00:24:50,675 --> 00:24:53,595
He's going to drive me berserk!

287
00:24:53,635 --> 00:24:57,395
Can't he give up?
There are plenty of other bars.

288
00:24:57,435 --> 00:24:59,395
Goodbye.

289
00:24:59,435 --> 00:25:00,685
Suzanne.

290
00:25:00,725 --> 00:25:02,645
- Suzanne.
- Yes.

291
00:25:02,685 --> 00:25:05,435
"Au gratin" means white sauce, right?

292
00:25:05,485 --> 00:25:07,105
Yes, why?

293
00:25:07,145 --> 00:25:12,195
I can't stomach it. Like you and horse meat.

294
00:25:12,235 --> 00:25:14,995
It's not my stomach, it's my memory.

295
00:25:16,035 --> 00:25:17,824
I'd rather cook human flesh.

296
00:25:17,864 --> 00:25:19,914
You're kidding!

297
00:25:31,044 --> 00:25:35,424
Suzanne, would you mind
if I left early today?

298
00:25:35,464 --> 00:25:37,514
What's his name?

299
00:25:37,554 --> 00:25:39,644
Dominique Bredoteau.

300
00:25:45,183 --> 00:25:47,023
Hello.

301
00:25:48,143 --> 00:25:50,063
Are you Dominique Bredoteau?

302
00:25:50,103 --> 00:25:51,483
That's me.

303
00:25:51,523 --> 00:25:53,523
Why?

304
00:25:53,573 --> 00:25:55,653
It's about...

305
00:25:56,693 --> 00:25:57,953
...the petition.

306
00:25:57,993 --> 00:25:59,413
Petition?

307
00:25:59,453 --> 00:26:04,203
Yes. The petition to...

308
00:26:05,623 --> 00:26:07,543
...to canonize Lady Di.

309
00:26:07,583 --> 00:26:09,252
No, thanks.

310
00:26:09,292 --> 00:26:10,332
No.

311
00:26:18,132 --> 00:26:20,722
Ladies and gentlemen, sorry to bother you...

312
00:26:25,682 --> 00:26:27,852
- Yes?
- Hello.

313
00:26:27,892 --> 00:26:31,562
I'm looking for Dominique Bredoteau
for the European census.

314
00:26:32,732 --> 00:26:34,772
Come up. Third floor.

315
00:26:45,121 --> 00:26:46,161
Hello, kitten.

316
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:50,751
Earl Grey?

317
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:52,881
Jasmine?

318
00:26:52,961 --> 00:26:55,961
What will you have?

319
00:26:59,881 --> 00:27:01,300
I'm working.

320
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,980
There. I'm coming.

321
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:17,400
Do you know where I can find
Dominique Bredoteau?

322
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,740
Oh, my poor dear!

323
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,990
You just missed him.

324
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:25,820
Look, there he goes now.

325
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:36,289
Bre-to-deau.

326
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:39,209
Not Bre-do-teau.

327
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:41,129
You need

328
00:27:41,219 --> 00:27:44,679
a glass of mulled wine.

329
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:46,549
Come in.

330
00:27:46,639 --> 00:27:47,849
Come on in.

331
00:27:50,889 --> 00:27:55,518
I've lived here for five years.
This is the first time we've met.

332
00:27:55,558 --> 00:27:58,318
I never go out on the landing.

333
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:02,358
I'm fussy about who I meet.

334
00:28:02,438 --> 00:28:03,988
They're all creeps anyway.

335
00:28:06,238 --> 00:28:08,778
Come in. Here.

336
00:28:08,868 --> 00:28:10,238
Come in.

337
00:28:11,288 --> 00:28:13,828
They call me the Glass Man,

338
00:28:13,908 --> 00:28:17,458
but my name is Raymond Dufayel.

339
00:28:18,628 --> 00:28:22,917
- Amélie Poulain. I'm a waitress at...
- The Two Windmills. I know.

340
00:28:23,967 --> 00:28:29,047
And you've come back empty-handed
from your search for Bretodeau.

341
00:28:30,597 --> 00:28:33,847
Because it's not "do", it's "to".

342
00:28:33,887 --> 00:28:36,397
- Like "Toto".
- Thank you.

343
00:28:40,227 --> 00:28:41,937
I love that painting.

344
00:28:41,977 --> 00:28:44,647
It's the Luncheon Of The Boating Party.

345
00:28:46,406 --> 00:28:47,406
By Renoir.

346
00:28:53,286 --> 00:28:57,206
I've painted one each year for twenty years.

347
00:28:58,876 --> 00:29:01,586
The hardest part is the looks.

348
00:29:01,626 --> 00:29:07,716
I sometimes feel they deliberately change
their mood as soon as my back's turned.

349
00:29:07,756 --> 00:29:09,386
They look quite happy there.

350
00:29:09,466 --> 00:29:11,755
They should be.

351
00:29:11,805 --> 00:29:13,845
This year they had hare with morels.

352
00:29:15,095 --> 00:29:18,685
And waffles with jam for the children.

353
00:29:18,765 --> 00:29:24,275
Now, what have I done
with that piece of paper?

354
00:29:26,395 --> 00:29:31,775
Ah, you've noticed my video camera
at the window.

355
00:29:31,825 --> 00:29:34,495
It's a gift from my sister-in-law.

356
00:29:34,535 --> 00:29:37,365
I put it there

357
00:29:37,455 --> 00:29:40,374
so I don't need to wind up my clocks.

358
00:29:41,784 --> 00:29:44,414
After all these years,

359
00:29:44,454 --> 00:29:48,794
the only person I still can't capture

360
00:29:48,834 --> 00:29:51,134
is the girl with the glass of water.

361
00:29:51,174 --> 00:29:52,674
She's in the middle,

362
00:29:52,714 --> 00:29:55,554
yet she's on the outside.

363
00:29:57,174 --> 00:29:59,724
Maybe she's just different from the others.

364
00:30:01,144 --> 00:30:02,604
In what way?

365
00:30:04,263 --> 00:30:05,683
I don't know.

366
00:30:05,723 --> 00:30:10,943
When she was little, she can't
have played much with other children.

367
00:30:12,773 --> 00:30:15,073
Maybe never.

368
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:20,163
Here.

369
00:30:20,203 --> 00:30:24,123
Dominique Bretodeau, 27 Rue Mouffetard.

370
00:30:25,453 --> 00:30:26,703
It's for you.

371
00:30:27,963 --> 00:30:32,922
Every Tuesday morning,
Dominique Bretodeau goes to buy a chicken.

372
00:30:33,002 --> 00:30:36,132
He usually roasts it
and has it with sauté potatoes.

373
00:30:36,172 --> 00:30:39,472
After carving the legs,
the breast and the wings,

374
00:30:39,512 --> 00:30:43,552
he loves picking the hot carcass
with his fingers,

375
00:30:43,602 --> 00:30:45,262
starting with the oysters.

376
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:52,272
But not today. Bretodeau won't buy a chicken.

377
00:30:52,312 --> 00:30:53,772
He'll go no further

378
00:30:53,812 --> 00:30:55,482
than this phone booth here.

379
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:09,179
In a flash, it all came back to him.

380
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:12,429
Federico Bahamontes
winning the Tour de France in '59.

381
00:32:15,438 --> 00:32:17,518
Aunt Josette's slips.

382
00:32:20,068 --> 00:32:23,148
And most of all, that tragic day.

383
00:32:24,528 --> 00:32:28,158
That tragic day
when he won all the marbles at break time.

384
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:38,038
Bretodeau!

385
00:32:41,207 --> 00:32:42,377
Bretodeau!

386
00:32:49,757 --> 00:32:52,137
The pinch, Bretodeau!

387
00:32:52,177 --> 00:32:54,267
Do you understand, Bretodeau?

388
00:33:01,977 --> 00:33:03,357
Cognac, please.

389
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:11,446
It's amazing, what just happened to me.

390
00:33:11,486 --> 00:33:15,706
It must be my guardian angel.
It's the only explanation.

391
00:33:15,746 --> 00:33:18,206
It was as if the phone booth was calling me.

392
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,666
It rang and rang.

393
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:26,256
Same here. The microwave's calling me.

394
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,596
I'll have another cognac.

395
00:33:39,265 --> 00:33:40,725
Life's strange.

396
00:33:43,225 --> 00:33:47,645
To a kid, time always drags.
Suddenly you're 50.

397
00:33:49,815 --> 00:33:51,905
All that's left of your childhood

398
00:33:51,945 --> 00:33:54,195
fits in a little box,

399
00:33:54,235 --> 00:33:55,695
a little rusty box.

400
00:33:59,114 --> 00:34:01,664
Have you got kids, miss?

401
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:09,424
I have a daughter.
She must be about your age.

402
00:34:13,174 --> 00:34:15,174
We haven't spoken for years.

403
00:34:16,214 --> 00:34:19,184
I heard she had a child, a boy.

404
00:34:20,344 --> 00:34:21,394
His name is Lucas.

405
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:32,523
I think it's time I looked them up
before I'm in a box myself.

406
00:34:33,823 --> 00:34:35,283
Don't you think?

407
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:47,253
Amélie suddenly has a strange feeling
of complete harmony.

408
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:53,252
It's a perfect moment.
Soft light, a scent in the air,
the quiet murmur of the city,

409
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,802
She breathes deeply.
Life seems so simple and clear.

410
00:34:57,842 --> 00:35:02,642
A surge of love,
an urge to help mankind suddenly engulfs her.

411
00:35:15,022 --> 00:35:17,651
Let me help you. Step down.

412
00:35:17,691 --> 00:35:20,741
Off we go!
We just passed the drum major's widow!

413
00:35:20,781 --> 00:35:23,781
She's worn his coat since the day he died.
Careful.

414
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:26,951
The horse's head on the butcher's
has lost an ear.

415
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:30,541
That's the florist laughing.
He has crinkly eyes.

416
00:35:30,581 --> 00:35:33,671
In the bakery window there are lollipops!

417
00:35:33,711 --> 00:35:35,501
Mmm. Smell that.

418
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:37,801
They're giving out melon slices.

419
00:35:39,461 --> 00:35:41,931
Sugarplum ice cream!

420
00:35:41,971 --> 00:35:44,640
We're passing the pork butcher.

421
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,100
Ham, 79 francs. Spareribs, 45!

422
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:51,980
Now the cheese shop.
Picodons are 12.90, cabecous 23.50.

423
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:56,610
At the butcher's a baby's watching a dog
that's watching the chickens roasting.

424
00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:00,070
Now we're at the newspaper kiosk
by the métro.

425
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:02,200
I'll leave you here. Bye.

426
00:36:53,658 --> 00:36:55,958
"She can't relate to other people."

427
00:36:58,168 --> 00:37:01,048
"She was always a lonely child."

428
00:37:04,007 --> 00:37:06,967
On a sparkling evening in July,

429
00:37:07,007 --> 00:37:09,887
while on the beaches holidaymakers

430
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:12,517
relax in the new-found sun,

431
00:37:12,557 --> 00:37:15,097
and in Paris the sweltering crowds

432
00:37:15,137 --> 00:37:17,517
gaze at the first bursts

433
00:37:17,557 --> 00:37:20,227
of the traditional fireworks,
Amélie Poulain,

434
00:37:20,267 --> 00:37:24,027
godmother of outcasts,

435
00:37:24,067 --> 00:37:26,567
Madonna of the unloved,

436
00:37:26,607 --> 00:37:28,776
finally succumbs to exhaustion.

437
00:37:28,816 --> 00:37:33,576
In Paris' grief-stricken streets,

438
00:37:33,616 --> 00:37:36,456
a vast throng of mourners

439
00:37:36,496 --> 00:37:39,626
line her funeral route in silence

440
00:37:39,666 --> 00:37:44,126
with the measureless sorrow
of newly orphaned children.

441
00:37:45,166 --> 00:37:47,296
What a strange destiny for one

442
00:37:47,336 --> 00:37:48,756
who gave her all,

443
00:37:48,796 --> 00:37:54,465
yet took such joy in life's simple pleasures.

444
00:37:54,515 --> 00:37:58,135
Like Don Quixote, she pitted herself

445
00:37:58,185 --> 00:38:01,355
against the grinding windmill
of all life's miseries.

446
00:38:13,785 --> 00:38:15,865
It was a losing battle

447
00:38:15,905 --> 00:38:17,905
that claimed her life too soon.

448
00:38:17,955 --> 00:38:20,244
At barely 23, Amélie Poulain

449
00:38:20,284 --> 00:38:23,914
let her young, tired body merge

450
00:38:23,954 --> 00:38:27,374
with the ebb and flow of universal woe.

451
00:38:27,414 --> 00:38:33,674
As she went, she felt a stab of regret
for letting her father die

452
00:38:33,714 --> 00:38:37,304
without trying to give his stifled life

453
00:38:37,344 --> 00:38:41,594
the breath of air she had given

454
00:38:41,644 --> 00:38:43,724
to so many others.

455
00:40:59,978 --> 00:41:01,028
Wait!

456
00:41:06,068 --> 00:41:07,868
Wait!

457
00:41:10,738 --> 00:41:11,788
Wait...

458
00:41:13,158 --> 00:41:14,208
Wait, wait!

459
00:42:00,786 --> 00:42:06,166
Pages full of dud ID photos
torn up and discarded by their owners,

460
00:42:06,256 --> 00:42:09,886
carefully reassembled by some oddball.

461
00:42:10,966 --> 00:42:13,006
Some family album!

462
00:42:17,175 --> 00:42:18,765
A pack of Gauloises.

463
00:42:18,845 --> 00:42:22,895
Just a second. It's so smoky in here.
Can you tell me where they are?

464
00:42:22,975 --> 00:42:25,645
- I can't see a thing.
- More to the left.

465
00:42:25,685 --> 00:42:27,315
- There?
- A bit more. There.

466
00:42:30,195 --> 00:42:32,485
Thank you. You need change.

467
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,945
Forget it.

468
00:42:35,035 --> 00:42:36,995
- Yes?
- A mauresque.

469
00:42:37,075 --> 00:42:39,535
A mauresque for the young man.

470
00:42:39,615 --> 00:42:42,994
One kir aligoté, one mauresque,
and two mint sodas.

471
00:42:43,084 --> 00:42:46,334
Was that prenuptial or post-coital smooching?

472
00:42:46,414 --> 00:42:48,464
Is your bullshit congenital?

473
00:42:50,504 --> 00:42:52,544
- Prenuptial.
- Don't worry.

474
00:42:52,634 --> 00:42:54,674
You'll find Mr. Right one day.

475
00:42:55,844 --> 00:42:59,094
All women want to sleep on a man's shoulder.
All of them.

476
00:42:59,184 --> 00:43:03,974
All men snore after a few drinks,
and I have a musical ear.

477
00:43:04,054 --> 00:43:07,773
I had an operation on my nasal cavities.

478
00:43:07,853 --> 00:43:09,893
I see you're a born romantic.

479
00:43:11,733 --> 00:43:14,483
I see you've never known true love.

480
00:43:15,823 --> 00:43:18,363
I did. It shortened my leg.

481
00:43:19,903 --> 00:43:24,373
- I thought you fell off a horse.
- I did.

482
00:43:24,453 --> 00:43:26,913
I was in love with a trapeze artist.

483
00:43:26,993 --> 00:43:30,253
I should have known.
They always drop you at the last minute.

484
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:33,002
He dropped me just before my act.

485
00:43:35,132 --> 00:43:38,712
It floored me. And the horse.

486
00:43:38,802 --> 00:43:41,802
With me under it.

487
00:43:43,762 --> 00:43:46,102
The mauresque?

488
00:43:46,182 --> 00:43:49,102
Still, true love does exist.

489
00:43:49,142 --> 00:43:53,062
I'm not saying it doesn't.
After 30 years behind this bar,

490
00:43:53,152 --> 00:43:56,822
I'm an expert. I can even
give you the recipe.

491
00:43:59,151 --> 00:44:01,901
Take two regulars.

492
00:44:01,951 --> 00:44:05,201
Let each think the other fancies them.
Leave it to simmer.

493
00:44:05,281 --> 00:44:07,161
It never fails.

494
00:44:16,131 --> 00:44:17,291
Excuse me!

495
00:44:17,381 --> 00:44:19,091
Excuse me.

496
00:44:19,171 --> 00:44:20,961
- I've had enough.
- I'll go.

497
00:44:24,641 --> 00:44:26,680
Haven't you hurt enough people?

498
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,140
Gina can defend herself.

499
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:35,480
I don't mean Gina. I mean Georgette.

500
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:39,690
Georgette?

501
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:42,860
Open your eyes! She craves your attention

502
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:44,700
but you only have eyes for Gina.

503
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:50,290
Poor girl! The things she does

504
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:52,369
to catch your eye!

505
00:44:54,959 --> 00:44:56,999
You really must be blind.

506
00:45:05,719 --> 00:45:07,759
I'm off on a date. Bye!

507
00:45:07,849 --> 00:45:09,929
Goodbye.

508
00:45:12,219 --> 00:45:14,599
Whoever her new one is,

509
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:18,228
he can't be worse
than that nut with his tape recorder.

510
00:45:19,438 --> 00:45:21,358
Joseph's not so nutty.

511
00:45:22,398 --> 00:45:24,148
He's just in pain.

512
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:27,198
Come off it, Amélie.
They split up two months ago.

513
00:45:27,238 --> 00:45:30,528
To keep on coming here every day,
he must be a masochist.

514
00:45:30,578 --> 00:45:33,618
Don't say you haven't noticed.

515
00:45:35,328 --> 00:45:36,498
Noticed what?

516
00:45:36,578 --> 00:45:39,458
He always sits here, right?

517
00:45:39,498 --> 00:45:41,038
Yes.

518
00:45:41,088 --> 00:45:42,458
Sit down.

519
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:44,757
Sit down, Georgette.

520
00:45:47,087 --> 00:45:50,177
- What can you see?
- My cigarette counter.

521
00:45:51,217 --> 00:45:53,427
And nothing's missing?

522
00:45:53,467 --> 00:45:54,467
No.

523
00:45:55,637 --> 00:45:57,097
Make an effort.

524
00:46:04,107 --> 00:46:05,987
I don't get it!

525
00:46:07,067 --> 00:46:09,656
I'll leave you to think about it. Good night.

526
00:46:26,376 --> 00:46:29,256
Good morning.

527
00:46:29,296 --> 00:46:32,796
Letter Arrives 30 Years Late.

528
00:46:32,846 --> 00:46:39,515
A mailbag found by climbers on a glacier
on Mont Blanc was part of a cargo

529
00:46:39,555 --> 00:46:43,145
lost in a plane crash in the late 1960s.

530
00:46:44,185 --> 00:46:47,685
So sad! A young, pretty princess for once.

531
00:46:47,735 --> 00:46:50,155
Would it be less sad if
she were old and ugly?

532
00:46:50,195 --> 00:46:52,405
Of course. Look at Mother Teresa.

533
00:46:54,275 --> 00:46:56,825
Is he still chasing Gina?

534
00:46:56,865 --> 00:46:59,115
No, he's after somebody else now.

535
00:46:59,155 --> 00:47:03,534
- Anyone I know?
- Yes.

536
00:47:03,584 --> 00:47:05,994
Funny about this glacier.

537
00:47:06,044 --> 00:47:08,914
Somebody at The Two Windmills?

538
00:47:08,964 --> 00:47:11,084
Not you, surely!

539
00:47:11,124 --> 00:47:12,334
No.

540
00:47:13,544 --> 00:47:16,344
Not Suzanne.

541
00:47:16,384 --> 00:47:18,344
Surely not!

542
00:47:18,384 --> 00:47:20,094
Yes.

543
00:47:23,764 --> 00:47:27,314
- Look. There he is again.
- How strange.

544
00:47:27,354 --> 00:47:30,733
- And here.
- Him again.

545
00:47:30,773 --> 00:47:32,353
"Gare de Lyon."

546
00:47:34,233 --> 00:47:35,273
And here.

547
00:47:35,323 --> 00:47:36,983
"March 5th, Austerlitz."

548
00:47:37,033 --> 00:47:40,953
Always the same blank expression.

549
00:47:42,033 --> 00:47:43,533
Twelve times.

550
00:47:43,573 --> 00:47:46,543
I counted.

551
00:47:46,583 --> 00:47:47,913
It's very odd.

552
00:47:47,953 --> 00:47:52,923
Why keep taking your picture all over town
only to throw them away?

553
00:47:52,963 --> 00:47:55,792
Good ones, too.

554
00:47:55,842 --> 00:47:58,712
It's like a sort of ritual.

555
00:47:58,762 --> 00:48:00,972
Maybe he's so terrified

556
00:48:01,012 --> 00:48:04,392
of growing old, it's his only consolation.

557
00:48:06,222 --> 00:48:07,512
He's dead.

558
00:48:08,772 --> 00:48:09,812
Dead?

559
00:48:09,852 --> 00:48:12,692
Yes. He's scared of being forgotten.

560
00:48:12,732 --> 00:48:16,942
So he uses the photo booths
to remind people what he looks like.

561
00:48:16,982 --> 00:48:21,401
Like faxing his portrait from the afterlife.

562
00:48:21,451 --> 00:48:25,451
A dead man who's scared of being forgotten.

563
00:48:25,491 --> 00:48:28,701
At least these guys here have made it.

564
00:48:28,741 --> 00:48:30,871
They're long dead,

565
00:48:30,911 --> 00:48:34,831
but they'll never be forgotten.

566
00:48:37,171 --> 00:48:39,631
- The girl with the glass...
- Yes.

567
00:48:39,671 --> 00:48:43,051
Maybe she's distracted
because she's thinking about someone.

568
00:48:43,091 --> 00:48:45,011
Somebody in the picture?

569
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,680
No.

570
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:50,430
More likely a boy she saw somewhere,

571
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:53,890
and felt an affinity with.

572
00:48:53,940 --> 00:49:00,110
You mean, she'd rather imagine herself
relating to someone who's absent

573
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:04,860
than build relationships
with those around her?

574
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,450
No.

575
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:12,659
Maybe she tries hard
to fix other people's messy lives.

576
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:14,659
What about her?

577
00:49:14,709 --> 00:49:17,669
And her own messy life?

578
00:49:19,169 --> 00:49:21,249
Who'll fix that?

579
00:49:22,919 --> 00:49:26,469
It's better to help people
than a garden gnome.

580
00:50:38,286 --> 00:50:43,456
The driver had 2.8g of alcohol in his blood!

581
00:50:43,496 --> 00:50:44,956
Makes me sick!

582
00:50:44,996 --> 00:50:47,966

00:50:49,336 --> 00:50:53,346

- Hold on, Amélie-mellow. Speed kills.

00:50:55,806 --> 00:50:59,515
No radar will ever catch him
while he's working, will it?

587
00:50:59,555 --> 00:51:02,055
You shouldn't do that, Mr. Collignon.

588
00:51:02,105 --> 00:51:04,015
It's not his fault.

589
00:51:04,065 --> 00:51:05,815
True, Mrs. Cauchoix!

590
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:09,855
It's not his fault he can't
sleep. It's Lady Di's.

591
00:51:11,605 --> 00:51:15,985
Guess what I found in the truck.
A lingerie catalogue.

592
00:51:16,035 --> 00:51:20,495
He'd pasted Lady Di's face over the model's.

593
00:51:21,915 --> 00:51:24,204
What today? Five asparagus,

594
00:51:24,244 --> 00:51:26,204
or more local history?

595
00:51:26,244 --> 00:51:27,544
Nothing.

The migraine seems to be better.

599
00:51:55,363 --> 00:51:59,283
Yes, but my sciatica kept me awake all night.

600
00:51:59,323 --> 00:52:03,243
- It's ages since I saw you looking so good.
- Really?

601
00:52:03,283 --> 00:52:08,413
A woman without love
withers like a flower without sun.

602
00:52:14,383 --> 00:52:16,462
Strange weather today.

603
00:52:16,502 --> 00:52:18,172
What's so funny?

604
00:52:18,212 --> 00:52:21,552
Everyone who's come in today
has given us a weather report.

605
00:52:21,592 --> 00:52:24,892
We pass the time of day
to forget how time passes.

We do it to keep us from talking crap.

607

I write crap but nobody wants to publish it.

608
00:52:30,232 --> 00:52:32,812
- Another rejection?
- My thirtieth.

609
00:52:32,852 --> 00:52:35,272
Isn't your cousin a book critic?

610
00:52:35,312 --> 00:52:38,362
Forget it! Critics are like leeches

611
00:52:38,402 --> 00:52:41,691
sucking the blood of writers.

612
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:45,241
Is your book a love story?

613
00:52:45,281 --> 00:52:48,411
No, it's about a guy who keeps a journal.

614
00:52:48,451 --> 00:52:50,791
Not about what's happened to him,

615
00:52:50,831 --> 00:52:53,621
but disasters that might
happen in the future.

616
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:59,001

- So basically, it's about a loafer.

00:53:01,171 --> 00:53:03,841
I'll dedicate the manuscript to you.

You're keeping well?

00:56:00,884 --> 00:56:02,344
Pretty much.

I feel a change.

636
00:56:09,564 --> 00:56:12,563
I had two heart attacks
and had to have an abortion

637
00:56:12,603 --> 00:56:15,063
because I did crack while I was pregnant.

Very good!

709
01:03:10,297 --> 01:03:11,347
Collignon...

710
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:15,517
- Collignon, big moron, down the john!
- That's it!

711
01:03:23,107 --> 01:03:25,527
OK! That's enough for today.

712
01:03:25,567 --> 01:03:27,567
Enough! Enough!

713
01:03:27,607 --> 01:03:30,567
Lucien, stop!

714
01:03:30,607 --> 01:03:32,367
Very good.

715
01:03:33,946 --> 01:03:37,406
Mr. Dufayel, I found this under your mat.

716
01:04:54,443 --> 01:04:56,483
Still no win!

717
01:04:56,523 --> 01:04:58,613
Me neither.

718
01:05:01,653 --> 01:05:02,703
May I?

719
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:06,123
There's a little...

720
01:05:11,963 --> 01:05:13,213
You're gorgeous

721
01:05:13,253 --> 01:05:14,963
when you blush.

722
01:05:16,003 --> 01:05:18,382
Like a wild flower.

723
01:05:18,422 --> 01:05:21,762
It's my dyspepsia.

724
01:05:23,432 --> 01:05:24,472
Morning, all.

725
01:05:26,012 --> 01:05:27,222
Beautiful day.

726
01:05:46,281 --> 01:05:48,031
Pack of Gitanes, please.

727
01:05:48,071 --> 01:05:52,001
Bravo! Vive la France! You scalded me.

728
01:05:52,041 --> 01:05:56,461
Bravo! Ten out of ten! Bull's-eye!

729
01:06:00,461 --> 01:06:02,631
It was Amélie. She...

730
01:06:36,619 --> 01:06:40,629
Do you know what happened
when they went up Mont Blanc?

731
01:06:40,669 --> 01:06:43,129
The silicon in her face froze up.

732
01:06:43,169 --> 01:06:47,679
Her face was a festering mass!

733
01:07:13,538 --> 01:07:17,328
Mulled wine and ginger biscuits.

734
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:20,038
Thank you.

735
01:07:20,078 --> 01:07:23,288
I was too hard the other day
on the girl with the glass.

736
01:07:24,338 --> 01:07:28,298
Tell me about that boy she saw.
Did they meet again?

737
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:30,887
No.

738
01:07:32,097 --> 01:07:33,757
They're into different things.

739
01:07:34,807 --> 01:07:37,387
Luck is like the Tour de France.

740
01:07:37,427 --> 01:07:39,517
You wait, and it flashes past you.

741
01:07:41,097 --> 01:07:45,067
You have to catch it while you can.

742
01:08:09,466 --> 01:08:11,216
Can I help you?

743
01:08:11,256 --> 01:08:14,426
Excuse me.
I found this album in the street and I...

744
01:08:14,466 --> 01:08:19,056
Nino will be so pleased!
He was so sad the other day.

745
01:08:19,096 --> 01:08:21,055
I almost prayed to St Anthony.

746
01:08:22,595 --> 01:08:24,805
Is... Nino there?

747
01:08:24,855 --> 01:08:27,645
No. On Wednesdays he works at the funfair.

748
01:08:29,985 --> 01:08:32,065
How long has he had this collection?

749
01:08:32,105 --> 01:08:36,575
Since I got him the job here, last year.

750
01:08:36,615 --> 01:08:40,825
Before, he collected footprints.
He worked nights.

751
01:08:40,865 --> 01:08:46,834
In the daytime
he took pictures of footprints in wet cement.

752
01:08:46,874 --> 01:08:49,044
He's a funny guy.

753
01:08:49,084 --> 01:08:51,374
When we met, he was a Santa Claus.

754
01:08:54,544 --> 01:08:56,294
Other things like...

755
01:08:56,344 --> 01:09:00,214
Whenever he heard a funny
laugh, he'd tape it.

756
01:09:04,394 --> 01:09:05,434
Really?

757
01:09:07,264 --> 01:09:09,894
Must be hard for his girlfriend.

758
01:09:09,934 --> 01:09:12,274
He never keeps them long.

759
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:15,103
Times are hard for dreamers.

760
01:09:15,153 --> 01:09:17,943
Eva! Where are those coffees?

761
01:09:17,983 --> 01:09:20,443
I'd better go. Thanks for the album.

762
01:09:20,493 --> 01:09:24,163
It's OK. I've got time to
take it to the funfair.

763
01:09:24,203 --> 01:09:28,663
Suit yourself. The ghost train.
Ask for Nino Quincampoix, like the street.

764
01:09:52,932 --> 01:09:55,062
I'm looking for Nino. Is he here?

765
01:09:55,102 --> 01:09:57,192
He doesn't get off till seven.

766
01:09:58,732 --> 01:10:01,152
- Is there no way to see him before?
- Sure.

767
01:10:02,492 --> 01:10:04,072
20 francs.

768
01:11:15,019 --> 01:11:16,639
See you next Wednesday.

769
01:11:28,318 --> 01:11:32,778
5pm tomorrow, Montmartre carousel
near the phone box. Bring a 5 franc piece.

770
01:11:50,887 --> 01:11:53,007
Want to know about her?

771
01:11:55,637 --> 01:11:58,477
- You know her? You saw her?
- You bet.

772
01:11:58,557 --> 01:12:00,517
She put us in her shirt pocket.

773
01:12:01,597 --> 01:12:03,147
Next to her breast.

774
01:12:03,227 --> 01:12:05,107
Is she pretty?

775
01:12:05,187 --> 01:12:07,107
Not bad.

776
01:12:08,187 --> 01:12:10,197
- Beautiful.
- No, pretty.

777
01:12:10,277 --> 01:12:11,567
- Beautiful.
- Pretty.

778
01:12:11,657 --> 01:12:15,447
- What does she want from you?
- She's broke.

779
01:12:15,526 --> 01:12:18,196
She wants a reward for the album.

780
01:12:18,286 --> 01:12:20,536
Or she collects photos, too.

781
01:12:20,616 --> 01:12:24,916
She wants to trade us
for a one-eyed man with glasses!

782
01:12:29,586 --> 01:12:30,586
No, you dope!

783
01:12:32,176 --> 01:12:34,506
She's in love.

784
01:12:34,596 --> 01:12:37,346
- I don't even know her.
- Yes, you do.

785
01:12:37,386 --> 01:12:39,176
Since when?

786
01:12:39,266 --> 01:12:40,976
You've always known her.

787
01:12:41,056 --> 01:12:42,305
In your dreams.

788
01:12:55,275 --> 01:12:56,825
Hello?

789
01:12:56,905 --> 01:13:00,955
Yes. You! Man with the
plastic bag! It's for you.

790
01:13:02,535 --> 01:13:03,995
- Me?
- Yes.

791
01:13:07,335 --> 01:13:08,334
Thank you.

792
01:13:10,334 --> 01:13:11,334
Hello?

793
01:13:11,414 --> 01:13:14,174
Follow the blue arrows, Mr. Quincampoix.

794
01:14:39,461 --> 01:14:43,921
When the finger's pointing to the sky,
only a fool looks at the finger.

795
01:15:56,448 --> 01:15:57,448
Hello?

796
01:15:58,538 --> 01:16:00,868
I know the stranger in the pictures.

797
01:16:00,918 --> 01:16:04,998
He's a ghost. He's invisible,
Mr. Quincampoix.

798
01:16:05,048 --> 01:16:08,418
He only appears when the film is developed.

799
01:16:08,468 --> 01:16:11,837
When a girl has her photo taken,

800
01:16:11,887 --> 01:16:17,847
he goes "Oooh!" in her ear,
while he gently caresses her neck.

801
01:16:17,887 --> 01:16:20,437
That's how he got caught, Mr. Quincampoix.

802
01:16:24,187 --> 01:16:25,477
Who are you?

803
01:16:25,517 --> 01:16:26,977
Page 51.

804
01:16:35,577 --> 01:16:37,156
[DO YOU

805
01:16:37,196 --> 01:16:39,036
WANT

806
01:16:39,076 --> 01:16:41,536
TO MEET ME?]

807
01:18:19,543 --> 01:18:22,382
Listen to this. "A boy of six,

808
01:18:22,422 --> 01:18:24,592
while his parents sleep, drives off

809
01:18:24,632 --> 01:18:26,392
in a pedal car.

810
01:18:26,432 --> 01:18:30,142
Found on a motorway
near Münster in Germany,

811
01:18:30,182 --> 01:18:33,772
he told the police he
wanted to see the stars."

812
01:18:33,812 --> 01:18:37,482
Isn't life beautiful, eh?

813
01:18:37,522 --> 01:18:42,112
Love. The only bug she hadn't caught!

814
01:18:42,152 --> 01:18:45,202
- Nobody's immune.
- At least it gives me a break.

815
01:18:45,242 --> 01:18:47,451
Love's a great beautician.

816
01:18:49,661 --> 01:18:53,121
What's she like? Tall? Small? Blonde? Dark?

817
01:18:55,541 --> 01:18:57,621
Let's say... average height.

818
01:18:58,881 --> 01:19:01,921
Not a dwarf or a giraffe. Normal.

819
01:19:03,301 --> 01:19:05,551
Pretty, for her type.

820
01:19:05,591 --> 01:19:07,931
As for blonde or dark...

821
01:19:09,511 --> 01:19:12,601
...it's hard to say,
but she wasn't a redhead.

822
01:19:12,641 --> 01:19:14,520
- Unless...
- Forget it.

823
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:20,520
I do remember she casually asked
if you had a girlfriend.

824
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:21,610
And?

825
01:19:21,650 --> 01:19:24,110
I said you weren't interested, right?

826
01:19:25,530 --> 01:19:27,030
You didn't!

827
01:19:27,070 --> 01:19:29,320
What do you care? You don't even know her.

828
01:19:30,370 --> 01:19:34,580
- Exactly. It's the mystery.
- You won't find mystery here.

829
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:36,830
A pound of nectarines, please.

830
01:19:36,870 --> 01:19:39,709
These ones here are the prettiest.

831
01:19:39,749 --> 01:19:41,879
Trust him. He's an artist!

832
01:19:41,919 --> 01:19:45,009
He's been going home every night
with tons of unsold stock.

833
01:19:45,049 --> 01:19:48,219
What for? Is he stewing a pig?

834
01:19:48,259 --> 01:19:50,429
No, sir! He's studying art!

835
01:19:50,469 --> 01:19:54,179
He sells leeks all day long
and paints turnips all night!

836
01:19:54,219 --> 01:19:56,309
The boy's a useless vegetable.

837
01:19:56,349 --> 01:19:57,849
A good prompter

838
01:19:57,889 --> 01:20:01,479
in each cellar window
whispering cutting retorts

839
01:20:01,519 --> 01:20:04,149
would mean shy people had the last laugh.

840
01:20:04,189 --> 01:20:06,648
At least you'll never be a vegetable.

841
01:20:06,688 --> 01:20:08,948
Even artichokes

842
01:20:08,988 --> 01:20:10,028
have hearts.

843
01:20:13,028 --> 01:20:16,658
You'll never be a vegetable.
Even artichokes have hearts!

844
01:20:58,076 --> 01:20:59,696
Memory seven.

845
01:21:17,386 --> 01:21:21,636
Darling Mado,
I miss you more and more each day.

846
01:21:21,686 --> 01:21:24,975
I'm an exile in a world of dreary khaki.

847
01:21:25,015 --> 01:21:27,315
I can't sleep, can't eat...

848
01:21:27,355 --> 01:21:30,065
This camp was the biggest mistake of my life,

849
01:21:30,105 --> 01:21:33,905
depriving me of my beloved
for five long weeks.

850
01:21:33,945 --> 01:21:36,825
I think of you endlessly. Your Adrien.

851
01:21:38,575 --> 01:21:43,365
I turned down my last month's wages
instead of giving notice.

852
01:21:44,415 --> 01:21:47,745
I dream of better times ahead.

853
01:21:47,785 --> 01:21:51,794
An orange-colored day. Remember, my love?

854
01:21:51,834 --> 01:21:53,924
Your ever-loving Adrien.

855
01:21:55,714 --> 01:21:57,134
Good news, darling Mado.

856
01:21:57,174 --> 01:22:00,514
Soon I'll be able to afford a car

857
01:22:00,554 --> 01:22:03,054
and drive home every night.

858
01:22:03,094 --> 01:22:07,514
Till then, meet me on
Friday and we'll go out.

859

Hello? Hello?

862
01:25:33,966 --> 01:25:36,426
[WHERE & WHEN?]

863
01:25:46,145 --> 01:25:48,605
One hour later at 11 Boulevard St Martin,

864
01:25:48,645 --> 01:25:52,275
Amélie walks into a party goods
and costume shop.

865
01:25:53,315 --> 01:25:57,775
At the same time,
a man leaves his home at 108 Rue Lecourbe.

866
01:25:59,735 --> 01:26:03,495
26 minutes later, Amélie is at the
photo booth at the Gare de l'Est.

867
01:26:07,745 --> 01:26:11,834
Simultaneously,
the man in red shoes parks outside.

868
01:26:11,874 --> 01:26:15,254
The time is exactly 11:40.

869
01:27:00,923 --> 01:27:02,962
At this precise moment,

870
01:27:03,052 --> 01:27:07,762
only Amélie has the key
to the riddle of the mystery man.

871
01:27:12,682 --> 01:27:14,352
How's it going, Mrs. Wells?

872
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:17,272
It's always better when it's not raining.

873
01:27:17,312 --> 01:27:19,732
- This is for you.
- Me?

874
01:27:29,701 --> 01:27:33,371
Dear Mrs. Wells,
We recently recovered a mailbag

875
01:27:33,451 --> 01:27:35,501
that was lost in a plane crash

876
01:27:35,581 --> 01:27:39,211
on October 12th 1969 on Mont Blanc.

We are forwarding the enclosed letter
to your address.

01:27:43,801 --> 01:27:47,931
Please accept our apologies
for the uncustomary delay.

I can't sleep, can't eat.

881

I think of you endlessly.

882
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:02,020
I know I've made
the biggest mistake of my life.

883
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:04,780
I turned down that woman's money.

884
01:28:04,860 --> 01:28:09,780
If all goes well,
I'll soon be able to afford a house.

885
01:28:09,860 --> 01:28:12,870
I dream of better times ahead

886
01:28:12,950 --> 01:28:16,790
when you'll forgive me and join me here

887
01:28:16,870 --> 01:28:20,210
one orange-colored day.
Your ever-loving Adrien.

888
01:28:50,068 --> 01:28:52,198
Mr. Dufayel, another package for you.

889
01:29:02,038 --> 01:29:05,288
Mr. Dufayel, do you know
what happened to the concierge?

890
01:29:06,708 --> 01:29:08,048
She got a letter.

891
01:29:09,088 --> 01:29:11,928
From her husband. 40 years late.

892
01:29:14,257 --> 01:29:16,307
That's a lot, isn't it, Mr. Dufayel?

893
01:29:29,567 --> 01:29:32,987
I'm not big on still life, Mr. Dufayel.

894
01:29:33,067 --> 01:29:36,077
Then work on your thin layer.

895
01:29:36,117 --> 01:29:38,867
Fat over thin. Always!

896
01:29:57,716 --> 01:29:59,516
- Mr. Dufayel...
- Yes!

897
01:29:59,556 --> 01:30:03,936
The papers said
that there'll soon be a new star.

898
01:30:03,976 --> 01:30:11,105
- So you're into stars now?
- I saw it on TV at my mum's, that's why.

899
01:30:12,945 --> 01:30:14,695
I don't know if it's true.

900
01:30:14,735 --> 01:30:17,025
In America

901
01:30:17,115 --> 01:30:20,405
they're going to take all
the rich people's ashes,

902
01:30:20,445 --> 01:30:23,115
put them in a satellite

903
01:30:23,155 --> 01:30:25,455
and shoot it into space.

904
01:30:25,535 --> 01:30:27,915
The satellite's going to shine forever.

905
01:30:32,544 --> 01:30:34,084
And Lady Di...

906
01:30:34,124 --> 01:30:36,384
Will they do the same for her?

907
01:30:36,424 --> 01:30:37,424
Lady Di, Lady Di!

908
01:30:37,504 --> 01:30:38,754
Give it a rest!

909
01:30:38,794 --> 01:30:41,554
I can't concentrate.

910
01:30:43,724 --> 01:30:44,724
Lady Di!

911
01:30:45,844 --> 01:30:46,844
Lady Di!

912
01:30:48,104 --> 01:30:49,144
Renoir.

913
01:32:30,450 --> 01:32:31,490
Morning, sir.

914
01:32:48,219 --> 01:32:49,259
Cambodia.

915
01:32:54,849 --> 01:32:56,599
I don't understand.

916
01:32:56,639 --> 01:33:00,519
Brilliant! You couldn't have done better.

917
01:33:00,559 --> 01:33:03,769
- Did it work?
- It's getting there.

918
01:33:03,809 --> 01:33:06,729
Ask me again any time. The harm's done.

919
01:33:06,779 --> 01:33:10,448
- What do you mean?
- Everybody calls me Snow White!

920
01:34:16,176 --> 01:34:19,006
[The Two Windmills café from 4pm.]

921
01:34:25,516 --> 01:34:27,435
- Eva?
- Yes?

922
01:34:27,475 --> 01:34:31,225
Could you stand in for me at four?

923
01:34:31,275 --> 01:34:33,195
Again?

924
01:34:36,525 --> 01:34:37,985
Close the door!

925
01:34:40,155 --> 01:34:42,155
What's up with him?

926
01:34:42,195 --> 01:34:43,955
Is he sulking?

927
01:34:43,995 --> 01:34:47,575
- He thinks I smile too much.
- He'd rather you frowned?

928
01:34:47,625 --> 01:34:50,545
With other men, yes.

929
01:34:53,254 --> 01:34:57,674
Nino is late. Amélie can only think
of two possible explanations.

930
01:34:57,714 --> 01:34:59,804
Firstly, that he didn't find the photo.

931
01:35:01,634 --> 01:35:04,094
Secondly, before he could assemble it,

932
01:35:04,134 --> 01:35:08,434
a gang of bank robbers took him hostage.

933
01:35:08,474 --> 01:35:10,474
The cops gave chase.

934
01:35:10,514 --> 01:35:12,314
They got away,

935
01:35:12,354 --> 01:35:15,104
but he caused a crash.

936
01:35:15,144 --> 01:35:17,354
When he came to,

937
01:35:17,404 --> 01:35:19,063
he'd lost his memory,

938
01:35:20,943 --> 01:35:22,823
An ex-con picked him up,

939
01:35:22,863 --> 01:35:27,073
mistook him for a fugitive,
and shipped him to Istanbul.

940
01:35:28,033 --> 01:35:30,283
He met some Afghan raiders,

941
01:35:30,333 --> 01:35:33,913
who took him to steal
some Russian warheads.

942
01:35:37,543 --> 01:35:41,383
But their truck hit a mine
at the border with Tajikistan.

943
01:35:41,423 --> 01:35:46,932
He survived, took to the hills,
and became a Mujaheddin.

944
01:35:46,972 --> 01:35:49,932
Amélie refuses to get upset for a guy

945
01:35:49,972 --> 01:35:54,562
who'll eat borscht all his life
in a hat like a tea cosy.

946
01:36:13,791 --> 01:36:16,001
- What can I get you?
- A coffee, please.

947
01:36:17,081 --> 01:36:18,961
A coffee.

948
01:36:40,980 --> 01:36:42,440
Here's your coffee.

949
01:36:43,980 --> 01:36:45,030
Thank you.

950
01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:11,049
[Today's menu]

951
01:37:20,059 --> 01:37:21,519
He's understood.

952
01:37:21,559 --> 01:37:24,769
He's going to put his teaspoon down,

953
01:37:26,189 --> 01:37:29,778
dip his finger in the sugar,

954
01:37:34,528 --> 01:37:37,238
turn around slowly,

955
01:37:37,288 --> 01:37:39,368
and speak to me.

956
01:37:44,958 --> 01:37:46,958
Excuse me.

957
01:37:48,458 --> 01:37:49,708
Is this you?

958
01:37:56,177 --> 01:37:57,427
Yes, it's you.

959
01:38:18,117 --> 01:38:20,197
I'll take that.

960
01:38:22,616 --> 01:38:24,286
Another coffee?

961
01:38:24,326 --> 01:38:26,456
- No, thanks. I'm fine.
- OK.

962
01:38:47,016 --> 01:38:51,475
So it's this man here,
the one with his hand up?

963
01:38:52,735 --> 01:38:53,775
Yes.

964
01:38:56,105 --> 01:38:58,985
Is she in love with him?

965
01:39:01,785 --> 01:39:02,825
Yes.

966
01:39:04,745 --> 01:39:08,125
I think it's time she took a real risk.

967
01:39:08,165 --> 01:39:12,665
She might just do that.
She's devising a stratagem.

968
01:39:12,705 --> 01:39:16,374
She's fond of stratagems.

969
01:39:18,424 --> 01:39:19,464
Yes.

970
01:39:21,174 --> 01:39:23,304
In fact, she's cowardly.

971
01:39:24,674 --> 01:39:28,054
That's why I can't capture her look.

972
01:39:29,894 --> 01:39:35,394
Dufayel's attempts to meddle are intolerable!

973
01:39:37,904 --> 01:39:43,863
If Amélie chooses to live in a dream

974
01:39:43,903 --> 01:39:48,113
and remain an introverted young woman,

975
01:39:48,163 --> 01:39:52,833
she has an absolute right
to mess up her life!

976
01:40:27,572 --> 01:40:29,322
What are you doing, Mr. Dufayel?

977
01:40:31,702 --> 01:40:33,831
Tell me, Lucien.

978
01:40:33,871 --> 01:40:38,751
For deliveries,
do you keep keys to all the apartments?

979
01:40:51,221 --> 01:40:55,101
One of your booths is out of order.

980
01:40:57,231 --> 01:40:59,770
It seems to be jammed.

981
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:03,190
Gare de l'Est ticket hall.

982
01:41:06,030 --> 01:41:08,400
- Buy a video, get one free.
- No, thanks.

983
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:16,830
Sam?

984
01:41:17,870 --> 01:41:18,910
Samantha?

985
01:41:22,250 --> 01:41:23,290
Samantha?

986
01:41:28,209 --> 01:41:30,129
Can you stand in for me at...

987
01:41:52,608 --> 01:41:56,238
Photo booth, Gare de l'Est ticket hall,
Tuesday 5pm.

988
01:41:56,328 --> 01:41:59,618
[Can you stand in for me this afternoon?]

989
01:43:10,895 --> 01:43:12,185
Almost done.

990
01:43:17,365 --> 01:43:21,405
The mystery man wasn't a ghost
or a man scared of ageing,

991
01:43:21,445 --> 01:43:23,495
but simply the repairman,

992
01:43:23,575 --> 01:43:26,035
a normal guy doing his job.

993
01:43:28,165 --> 01:43:29,785
Sorry.

994
01:44:15,453 --> 01:44:18,793
He keeps spying on me!
It's making me sick.

995
01:44:18,873 --> 01:44:22,293
4:05: Blatant female conspiracy.

996
01:44:23,343 --> 01:44:26,763
Gosh, you're tense, Georgette!

997
01:44:27,842 --> 01:44:29,392
Good luck. You'll need it.

998
01:44:34,812 --> 01:44:39,352
Excuse me. Did you put this in my pocket?

999
01:44:39,442 --> 01:44:42,862
- Yes, but I'm not the one...
- I know. Where is she?

1000
01:44:42,902 --> 01:44:44,442
She's at her father's.

1001
01:44:44,482 --> 01:44:49,912
It's awkward. I'd like to speak to
you, but... I finish work at six.

1002
01:44:49,952 --> 01:44:51,912
- Can you come back?
- OK.

1003
01:44:52,952 --> 01:44:54,031
See you later.

1004
01:44:54,081 --> 01:44:57,661
4:08: Docking scheduled.

1005
01:45:29,490 --> 01:45:34,160
The blond guy in a camel coat.
He's very absent-minded, too.

1006
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:35,950
How come?

1007
01:45:36,990 --> 01:45:39,460
He came back three times the same afternoon.

1008
01:45:40,710 --> 01:45:41,960
1:12:

1009
01:45:42,040 --> 01:45:43,290
Camel coat.

1010
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:44,630
2:50:

1011
01:45:44,670 --> 01:45:46,499
Camel coat.

1012
01:45:46,549 --> 01:45:48,759
- 4:17: Camel coat.
- Stop it!

1013
01:45:49,799 --> 01:45:53,009
My rash has come back! Look, Suzanne!

1014
01:45:53,049 --> 01:45:56,759
My rash is back. He's driving me nuts.

1015
01:45:56,809 --> 01:45:58,969
Lay off!

1016
01:45:59,019 --> 01:46:03,309
If she had a clear conscience,
she wouldn't be in such a state.

1017
01:46:03,349 --> 01:46:05,309
I've had it. I'm going home.

1018
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:08,859
Psychos are the last straw!

1019
01:46:10,239 --> 01:46:12,278
Georgette! Georg...

1020
01:46:13,858 --> 01:46:16,618
Stop smothering them!
Women need to breathe.

1021
01:46:16,658 --> 01:46:19,948
You let them breathe,
they want a change of air.

1022
01:46:19,998 --> 01:46:21,868
Fresh air's healthy.

1023
01:46:21,908 --> 01:46:23,918
Shut it, failure!

1024
01:46:26,458 --> 01:46:28,168
Failed writer, failed life...

1025
01:46:28,208 --> 01:46:30,798
I love the word "fail".

1026
01:46:30,838 --> 01:46:32,878
Failure is human destiny.

1027
01:46:32,928 --> 01:46:34,508
It's gasbag time!

1028
01:46:34,548 --> 01:46:37,807
Failure teaches us that life is but a draft,

1029
01:46:37,847 --> 01:46:41,727
a long rehearsal for a
show that will never play.

1030
01:46:43,137 --> 01:46:45,477
I bet he stole that.

1031
01:46:45,517 --> 01:46:48,017
I do have some original ideas,

1032
01:46:48,067 --> 01:46:53,527
but people always steal them.
A bit like your women.

1033
01:46:53,567 --> 01:46:55,607
Meaning?

1034
01:46:55,657 --> 01:46:58,867
Meaning you'd better get used to it.

1035
01:46:58,907 --> 01:47:01,447
Speak for yourself, you...

1036
01:47:01,497 --> 01:47:02,537
What?

1037
01:47:06,286 --> 01:47:09,416
- What's going on?
- Nothing much. Georgette went out.

1038
01:47:09,456 --> 01:47:11,206
Joseph got mad.

1039
01:47:11,256 --> 01:47:12,756
"Went out?"

1040
01:47:12,796 --> 01:47:18,006
Just like Gina. You know who's she's with?
The guy with the plastic bag.

1041
01:47:19,716 --> 01:47:22,096
I saw their little game.

1042
01:47:22,136 --> 01:47:24,476
The note in the coat pocket,

1043
01:47:24,516 --> 01:47:26,146
4:08.

1044
01:47:26,186 --> 01:47:30,145
Back he comes, and hey presto!
Out they go.

1045
01:47:34,065 --> 01:47:37,735
- I'm worried for Amélie because I like you.
- What do you mean?

1046
01:47:38,775 --> 01:47:42,575
By and large, the men I like
are mentally unsound.

1047
01:47:42,615 --> 01:47:45,655
- I'd like to know more about you.
- Ask me questions.

1048
01:47:48,455 --> 01:47:50,245
One swallow doesn't make...?

1049
01:47:51,335 --> 01:47:52,375
A swallow?

1050
01:47:53,955 --> 01:47:55,505
A summer.

1051
01:47:55,545 --> 01:47:56,924
And clothes...?

1052
01:47:56,964 --> 01:47:58,504
The man.

1053
01:47:58,544 --> 01:47:59,964
- A good cat deserves...?
- A rat.

1054
01:48:00,004 --> 01:48:01,674
- Patience...?
- Is a virtue.

1055
01:48:01,714 --> 01:48:03,304
- Rolling stone...?
- Gathers no moss.

1056
01:48:03,344 --> 01:48:05,674
- It's a sin...?
- To steal a pin.

1057
01:48:05,724 --> 01:48:07,724
Absence makes...?

1058
01:48:07,764 --> 01:48:09,224
The heart grow fonder.

1059
01:48:09,264 --> 01:48:11,264
- Not bad.
- You collect them?

1060
01:48:11,314 --> 01:48:15,644
In my family, we say a man
who knows his proverbs can't be all bad.

1061
01:48:20,234 --> 01:48:23,693
Pretty girl from the 5th
floor, listen to this!

1062
01:48:23,733 --> 01:48:26,703
- Do you believe in miracles?
- Not today.

1063
01:48:28,113 --> 01:48:30,283
You're in for a surprise.

1064
01:48:30,323 --> 01:48:33,663
What if I told you that a team of climbers

1065
01:48:33,703 --> 01:48:37,663
on Mont Blanc had found

1066
01:48:37,713 --> 01:48:42,343
hard proof that my husband loved me?

1067
01:49:15,701 --> 01:49:17,831
Lucien, I need some yeast.

1068
01:49:17,871 --> 01:49:21,791
For Miss Amélie?
She's baking her famous plum cake?

1069
01:49:21,831 --> 01:49:24,801
Collignon! Go and get the yeast.

1070
01:50:18,969 --> 01:50:20,599
Amélie?

1071
01:50:20,639 --> 01:50:21,689
Amélie?

1072
01:50:29,029 --> 01:50:30,069
Amélie?

1073
01:50:51,918 --> 01:50:52,968
[I'll be back]

1074
01:51:24,037 --> 01:51:27,036
Go into the bedroom, Miss Poulain.

1075
01:51:43,096 --> 01:51:46,226
So, little Amélie,

1076
01:51:46,266 --> 01:51:50,356
your bones aren't made of glass.

1077
01:51:50,396 --> 01:51:53,525
You can take life's knocks.

1078
01:51:53,565 --> 01:51:57,945
If you let this chance go by,

1079
01:51:57,985 --> 01:52:04,655
eventually your heart will become

1080
01:52:04,695 --> 01:52:10,745
as dry and brittle as my skeleton.

1081
01:52:12,375 --> 01:52:13,915
So...

1082
01:52:13,955 --> 01:52:17,124
Go and get him, for pete's sake!

1083
01:55:04,618 --> 01:55:10,458
[Without you, today's emotions
would be the scurf of yesterday's]

1084
01:56:06,766 --> 01:56:08,476
International airport.

1085
01:56:08,516 --> 01:56:13,565
September 28th 1997. It is exactly 11am.

1086
01:56:13,605 --> 01:56:16,315
At the funfair, near the ghost train,

1087
01:56:16,355 --> 01:56:19,525
the marshmallow twister is twisting.

1088
01:56:19,565 --> 01:56:21,865
Meanwhile, on a bench in Villette Square,

1089
01:56:21,905 --> 01:56:27,365
Félix Lerbier learns there are more links
in his brain than atoms in the universe.

1090
01:56:28,455 --> 01:56:29,575
Meanwhile,

1091
01:56:29,625 --> 01:56:33,295
at the Sacré Cœur,
the nuns are practicing their backhand.

1092
01:56:33,375 --> 01:56:35,755
The temperature is 24°C,

1093
01:56:35,795 --> 01:56:37,675
humidity 70%,

1094
01:56:37,715 --> 01:56:40,964
atmospheric pressure 999 millibars.
