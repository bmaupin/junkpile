landed on Rue St Vincent, Montmartre.

At the same moment,
on a restaurant terrace nearby,

5
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,200
the wind magically made two glasses
dance unseen on a tablecloth.

6
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:10,080
Meanwhile, in a 5th-floor flat,
28 Avenue Trudaine, Paris 9,

00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,920
returning from his best friend's funeral,

made a dash for an egg in his wife Amandine.

Nine months later,

00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,780
Amélie Poulain was born.

Raphaël Poulain dislikes:

19
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:35,770
Peeing next to someone
else. He also dislikes:

20
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,520
Catching scornful glances at his sandals.

21
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,150
Clingy wet swimming trunks.

Raphaël Poulain likes:

23
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,160
Peeling off large strips of wallpaper.

24
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,750
Lining up all his shoes and polishing them.

25
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,000
Emptying his tool box,

26
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,920
cleaning it out,

27
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,010
and putting everything back.

Amélie's mother, Amandine,
a schoolmistress from Gueugnon,

29
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,310
has always had shaky nerves.

Getting puckered fingers in the bath.

32
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,860
When someone she doesn't like

33
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,610
brushes against her hand.

34
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:29,530

Amélie is six.

41
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,180
Like all little girls,
she'd like to be hugged by her daddy.

42
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:58,270
But he never touches her,
except for a monthly checkup.

43
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,020
The thrill of this rare contact

44
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,360
makes her heart beat like a drum.

45
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,940

tossed about
between a neurotic and an iceberg,

Alas, the home environment
has made Blubber suicidal.

66
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:24,480
Blubber's suicide attempts
destroy Mother's nerves.

67
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,150
A decision is made.

68
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,570
Enough!

69
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,270
To comfort Amélie, her mother
gives her a second-hand Instamatic camera.

70
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,540
Little girl! Look what you did!

71
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:25,750
A neighbor fools her into thinking
her camera causes accidents.

72
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:30,460
Because she'd been taking pictures
all afternoon, Amélie is petrified.

73
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,510
She stares at the TV, racked by the guilt

74
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:36,680
of causing a huge fire,

75
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,640
two derailments

76
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,560

Amélie gets her revenge.

80

What...?

One day tragedy strikes.

82
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:35,570
Amandine takes Amélie to Notre Dame to
light a candle and pray for a baby brother.

83
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,990
Three minutes later, heaven sends,

84
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:43,200
alas, not a baby boy, but Marguerite,
a tourist from Quebec,

85
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,330
bent on ending her life.

86
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,880
Amandine Poulain is killed instantly.

87
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:58,180
After her mother's death,
Amélie lives alone with her father.

88
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:02,260
His unsociable tendencies increase.

89
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,770
He's obsessed with building
a miniature shrine

90
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:08,020
to house his wife's ashes.

91
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,650
Days, months and years go by.

92
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,620
In such a dead world,

93
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:27,330
Amélie prefers to dream
until she's old enough to leave home.

94
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:41,010
Five years later,
she's a waitress in Montmartre

95
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,220
at The Two Windmills.

96
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,180
It is August 29th.

97
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,940
In 48 hours, her life will change forever.

98
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:54,610
But she doesn't know it yet.

99
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:59,320
She lives quietly among her colleagues
and the café's regulars.

100
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,860
That's Suzanne, the owner.

101
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,740
She limps a little but
she's never spilt a drink.

102
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,910
When she was younger, she was a circus rider.

103
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,540
She likes athletes who
cry with disappointment.

104
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:15,590
She dislikes seeing men humiliated
in front of their kids in her café.

105
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:19,590
Georgette is the tobacconist.
She's a hypochondriac.

106
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:24,340
Migraines one day, sciatica the next.
She hates the words

107
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,600
"fruit of thy womb".

108
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,810
Gina works with Amélie.
Her grandmother was a healer.

109
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:33,850
She likes cracking bones.

110
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,320
She's bringing a kir to
Hipolito, a failed writer.

111
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,900
He likes seeing bullfighters gored on TV.

112
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:47,450
Scowling at them is Joseph,
Gina's rejected lover.

113
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,080
He's always jealously spying on her.

114
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,870
All he likes

115
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,880
is popping bubble wrap.

116
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,380
And here's Philomène, an air hostess.

117
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,420
Amélie looks after her cat Rodrigue
when she's away. Philomène likes

118
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,380
the sound of the cat's bowl on the tiles.

119
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:08,390
Rodrigue likes overhearing
children's stories.

120
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,230
No, thanks, ma'am. I never work on Sundays.

121
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:17,980
At weekends, Amélie often takes a train
from the Gare du Nord to see her father.

122
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,990
- Why don't you use your retirement to...?
- To do what?

123
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,110
Travel. You've never been away.

124
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:29,700
When we were young,
your mother and I longed to travel.

125
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,250
But we couldn't.

126
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:36,290
- Because of your heart.
- Yes. I know.

127
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,710
So now...

128
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,590
Now...

129
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,470
Some Friday evenings,
Amélie goes to the cinema.

130
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:47,180
I like turning round
and looking at people's faces in the dark.

131
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,560
I like noticing details
that no-one else ever sees.

132
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:04,190
But I hate it in old American movies
when drivers don't watch the road.

133
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,040
Amélie doesn't have a boyfriend.

134
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,460
She tried once or twice,
but the results were a let-down.

135
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:20,340
Instead, she cultivates a taste
for small pleasures.

136
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,880
Plunging her hand deep into a sack of grain.

137
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,720
Cracking crème brûlée

138
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,760
with a teaspoon.

139
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,390
And skimming stones on the Canal St Martin.

140
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:19,270
They call him the Glass Man.

141
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:22,060
He was born with bones as brittle as crystal.

142
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,530
All his furniture is padded.

143
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,950
A handshake would be enough
to crush his fingers.

144
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:31,110
He's stayed indoors for 20 years.

145
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,330
Time has changed nothing.

146
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,710
Amélie still takes refuge in solitude.

147
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:44,420
She amuses herself with silly questions
about the world below,

148
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,470
such as: "How many couples
are having an orgasm now?"

149
00:13:58,770 --> 00:13:59,930
Fifteen.

150
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,900
Finally, on the night of August 30th 1997.

151
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:10,570
comes the event
that will change her life forever.

152
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:15,280
Lady Di, Princess of Wales,
died in a car crash in Paris last night

153
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:19,250
with her companion Dodi Al Fayed...

154
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:13,760
Only the first man
to discover Tutankhamen's tomb

155
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,930
would understand how she felt

156
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:18,180
on finding this treasure

157
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:22,100
hidden by a little boy 40 years ago.

158
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:30,150
On August 31st at 4am,

159
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,280
Amélie has a dazzling idea.

160
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,860
Wherever he was,
she would find the box's owner

161
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,200
and give him back his treasure.

162
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:44,040
If he was touched,
she'd become a regular do-gooder.

163
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,080
If not, too bad.

164
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:56,840
The girl from the 5th floor!
We don't see much of you.

165
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,180
Would you know of a boy
who lived in my flat in the '50s?

166
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,470
A boy? Come and have a glass of port.

167
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:08,060
- No, thanks.
- Come in! Close the door.

168
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,230
Boys? I've known so many.

169
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,570
They're cute until they discover
snowballs and chestnuts.

170
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,700
I've known so many boys.

171
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,290
- When did you come here?
- In '64.

172
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,080
You'll have heard the story.

173
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,330
No, I don't think so.

174
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,210
I'm amazed. Sit down.

175
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,920
My husband worked for Ladybird Insurance.

176
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,430
It's no secret that he
slept with his secretary.

177
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,430
They used every hotel around.

178
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,180
Not the grotty ones, either.

179
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,560
The bimbo liked spreading her legs,

180
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,100
but only on satin.

181
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,150
So my husband swiped from the till.

182
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:54,230
A little at first, then 50 million.

183
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,570
Off they flew to South America.

184
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,870
Drink up.

185
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:05,950
On January 20th 1970,

186
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,410
my doorbell rang.

187
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:13,540
"Your husband's been killed
in a car crash in South America."

188
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,710
My life stopped there.

189
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,930
And Black Lion died of heartbreak.

190
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:22,800
Poor creature.

191
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,430
See how lovingly

192
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,520
he still stares at his master?

193
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,600
One day

194
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,150
I'll read you his letters.

195
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,940
No, don't go!

196
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,440
You can spare five minutes.

197
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,150
He wrote this

198
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,860
from the barracks.

199
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:44,950
"Darling Mado." That's me.

200
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,660
I'm called Madeleine.

201
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,710
"I can't sleep, can't eat,

202
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:54,540
knowing that my only reason to live
is far away in Paris.

203
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:57,000
I won't see her until a fortnight on Friday,

204
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:02,840
when my sweet little weasel
appears at the station

205
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,970
in her strappy blue dress."

206
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:10,060
In brackets: "The one you think
is too transparent."

207
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,950
Has anyone ever written to you like that?

208
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:25,070
No. I'm nobody's little weasel.

209
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,700
My name's Madeleine Wells.

210
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,830
Madeleine, like Mary Magdalene.

211
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:34,380
She wept, right? And Wells as in water.

212
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:38,630
Talk about being born to cry!

213
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,050
About your question...

214
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:49,560
Ask Collignon, the grocer.
He's lived here all his life.

215
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,020
Hello, Amélie-mellow!

216
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,600
A fig and three hazelnuts, as usual?

217
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,440
Who lived in my flat in the '50s?

218
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,490
- What was their name?
- You've got me there, dear.

219
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:06,490
In 1950, I was two.
The mental age of this cretin.

220
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,160
The "cretin" is Lucien.

221
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,250
He's no genius, but Amélie likes him.
She likes the way

222
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:15,620
he handles each endive like a precious object

223
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:18,880
to be treated with care.
It's his way of showing

224
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,340
his love of good work.

225
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,420
Look at him!

226
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:25,930
Like he's nursing a baby bird
that's fallen out of its nest!

227
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,640
Don't ask him for currants!

228
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,310
You'd be here till Monday!

229
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,520
Get moving, spastic!

230
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,600
She hasn't got all day.

231
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,650
Here.

232
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:44,400
Go and see my mother.
She has the memory of an elephant.

233
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,610
Elephant Mum!

234
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,410
Thank you.

235
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,140
Bredoteau.

236
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,760
Sorry?

237
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,600
It's the name you're after.

238
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:18,060
But if it's me that says so,
it won't count. I'm senile.

239
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,060
Ignore him. He's senile.

240
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,190
See what he's done to my laurel?

241
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,990
His old job was punching métro tickets.

242
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:35,250
For three months now,
he's got up every night to punch holes

243
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:38,790
- in my laurels!
- I'd have preferred lilacs. Such is life!

244
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:43,300
- We all need a way to relax.
- I skim stones.

245
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:47,510
- You do?
- I'll find it. Don't worry.

246
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:50,510
- I file everything.
- Like what?

247
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:55,350
Your son's nearly 50
and I'm still doing his book-keeping.

248
00:20:55,390 --> 00:21:00,100
You were still squeezing his
toothpaste at 15, so it follows.

249
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:02,520
Right. Camus...

250
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:06,570
2nd floor on the right. Brossard...
Brossard was on staircase B.

251
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,200
Got it!

252
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,360
Bredoteau, 5th floor on the right.

253
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:13,160
They were from the Pas de Calais.

254
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,830
Bredoteau. What more can I say?

255
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,270
Groping under the photo booth
is Nino Quincampoix.

256
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:33,410
When Amélie lacked playmates,
Nino had too many.

257
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:49,630
Five miles apart, one dreamed
of having a sister, the other a brother

258
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,720
to spend all their time with.

259
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,400
Hi, Dad.

260
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,410
A new friend?

261
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:20,660
No, I've had him for years.

262
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,620
Your mother hated him,
so he lived in the tool shed.

263
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,670
There. Let's reconcile them.

264
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:33,170
There. Not bad, eh?

265
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:42,520
Dad, if you found a precious relic
from your childhood,

266
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,440
how would it make you feel?
Happy? Sad? Nostalgic? What?

267
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,020
I didn't have this gnome when I was a child.

268
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:53,690
He was a retirement gift
from my old regiment.

269
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:58,200
No, I mean something you hid
like a secret treasure.

270
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,830
I should varnish him before autumn.

271
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:08,380
I'll make some tea. Do you want some?

272
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,500
Breathe in. Hold still.

273
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,300
Better now?

274
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,220
Shut the door!

275
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,300
There's a howling gale.

276
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,350
It's hardly Siberia.

277
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,970
I can see you're not allergic

278
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:27,690
to car fumes.
I almost coughed up my pleura last night.

279
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,230
Coughed up a pleura? Sure.

280
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:32,860
- What's on the menu today, Suzanne?
- Endives au gratin.

281
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,360
They'll have you on your knees, you'll see.

282
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,610
They're good, then?

283
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,860
- Depends where.
- If it's at the toilet...

284
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,200
Not good!

285
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:49,710
12:15, laughs orgasmically
to attract alpha male.

286
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,670
He's going to drive me berserk!

287
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:56,470
Can't he give up?
There are plenty of other bars.

288
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,470
Goodbye.

289
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,760
Suzanne.

290
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,720
- Suzanne.
- Yes.

291
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,510
"Au gratin" means white sauce, right?

292
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,180
Yes, why?

293
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:11,270
I can't stomach it. Like you and horse meat.

294
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:14,070
It's not my stomach, it's my memory.

295
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,900
I'd rather cook human flesh.

296
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,990
You're kidding!

297
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,500
Suzanne, would you mind
if I left early today?

298
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,590
What's his name?

299
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,720
Dominique Bredoteau.

300
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,100
Hello.

301
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,140
Are you Dominique Bredoteau?

302
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,560
That's me.

303
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,600
Why?

304
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,730
It's about...

305
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:57,030
...the petition.

306
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,490
Petition?

307
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:03,280
Yes. The petition to...

308
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,620
...to canonize Lady Di.

309
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,330
No, thanks.

310
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:09,410
No.

311
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:19,800
Ladies and gentlemen, sorry to bother you...

312
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,930
- Yes?
- Hello.

313
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:30,640
I'm looking for Dominique Bredoteau
for the European census.

314
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:33,850
Come up. Third floor.

315
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,240
Hello, kitten.

316
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,830
Earl Grey?

317
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:51,960
Jasmine?

318
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:55,040
What will you have?

319
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,380
I'm working.

320
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:12,060
There. I'm coming.

321
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:16,480
Do you know where I can find
Dominique Bredoteau?

322
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,820
Oh, my poor dear!

323
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,070
You just missed him.

324
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:24,900
Look, there he goes now.

325
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:35,370
Bre-to-deau.

326
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,290
Not Bre-do-teau.

327
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:40,210
You need

328
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,760
a glass of mulled wine.

329
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,630
Come in.

330
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,930
Come on in.

331
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:54,600
I've lived here for five years.
This is the first time we've met.

332
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,400
I never go out on the landing.

333
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,440
I'm fussy about who I meet.

334
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,070
They're all creeps anyway.

335
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,860
Come in. Here.

336
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,320
Come in.

337
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:12,910
They call me the Glass Man,

338
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:16,540
but my name is Raymond Dufayel.

339
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:22,000
- Amélie Poulain. I'm a waitress at...
- The Two Windmills. I know.

340
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:28,130
And you've come back empty-handed
from your search for Bretodeau.

341
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,930
Because it's not "do", it's "to".

342
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:35,480
- Like "Toto".
- Thank you.

343
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:41,020
I love that painting.

344
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,730
It's the Luncheon Of The Boating Party.

345
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,490
By Renoir.

346
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:56,290
I've painted one each year for twenty years.

347
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,670
The hardest part is the looks.

348
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:06,800
I sometimes feel they deliberately change
their mood as soon as my back's turned.

349
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,470
They look quite happy there.

350
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,840
They should be.

351
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,930
This year they had hare with morels.

352
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:17,770
And waffles with jam for the children.

353
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:23,360
Now, what have I done
with that piece of paper?

354
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,860
Ah, you've noticed my video camera
at the window.

355
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:33,580
It's a gift from my sister-in-law.

356
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:36,450
I put it there

357
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:39,460
so I don't need to wind up my clocks.

358
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:43,500
After all these years,

359
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:47,880
the only person I still can't capture

360
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,220
is the girl with the glass of water.

361
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,760
She's in the middle,

362
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,640
yet she's on the outside.

363
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,810
Maybe she's just different from the others.

364
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,690
In what way?

365
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,770
I don't know.

366
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:10,030
When she was little, she can't
have played much with other children.

367
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,160
Maybe never.

368
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:19,250
Here.

369
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:23,210
Dominique Bretodeau, 27 Rue Mouffetard.

370
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,790
It's for you.

371
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:32,010
Every Tuesday morning,
Dominique Bretodeau goes to buy a chicken.

372
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:35,220
He usually roasts it
and has it with sauté potatoes.

373
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:38,560
After carving the legs,
the breast and the wings,

374
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,640
he loves picking the hot carcass
with his fingers,

375
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:44,350
starting with the oysters.

376
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,360
But not today. Bretodeau won't buy a chicken.

377
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,860
He'll go no further

378
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,570
than this phone booth here.

379
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:08,270
In a flash, it all came back to him.

380
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:11,520
Federico Bahamontes
winning the Tour de France in '59.

381
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,610
Aunt Josette's slips.

382
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,240
And most of all, that tragic day.

383
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:27,250
That tragic day
when he won all the marbles at break time.

384
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:37,130
Bretodeau!

385
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,470
Bretodeau!

386
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:51,230
The pinch, Bretodeau!

387
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,360
Do you understand, Bretodeau?

388
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,450
Cognac, please.

389
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:10,540
It's amazing, what just happened to me.

390
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:14,800
It must be my guardian angel.
It's the only explanation.

391
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,300
It was as if the phone booth was calling me.

392
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,760
It rang and rang.

393
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:25,350
Same here. The microwave's calling me.

394
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,690
I'll have another cognac.

395
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,820
Life's strange.

396
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,740
To a kid, time always drags.
Suddenly you're 50.

397
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:51,000
All that's left of your childhood

398
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,290
fits in a little box,

399
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:54,790
a little rusty box.

400
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:00,760
Have you got kids, miss?

401
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:08,520
I have a daughter.
She must be about your age.

402
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:14,270
We haven't spoken for years.

403
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:18,280
I heard she had a child, a boy.

404
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,490
His name is Lucas.

405
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:31,620
I think it's time I looked them up
before I'm in a box myself.

406
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,380
Don't you think?

407
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:46,350
Amélie suddenly has a strange feeling
of complete harmony.

408
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:52,350
It's a perfect moment.
Soft light, a scent in the air,
the quiet murmur of the city,

409
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:56,900
She breathes deeply.
Life seems so simple and clear.

410
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:01,740
A surge of love,
an urge to help mankind suddenly engulfs her.

411
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,750
Let me help you. Step down.

412
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:19,840
Off we go!
We just passed the drum major's widow!

413
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,880
She's worn his coat since the day he died.
Careful.

414
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,050
The horse's head on the butcher's
has lost an ear.

415
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:29,640
That's the florist laughing.
He has crinkly eyes.

416
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,770
In the bakery window there are lollipops!

417
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:34,600
Mmm. Smell that.

418
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,900
They're giving out melon slices.

419
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,030
Sugarplum ice cream!

420
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:43,740
We're passing the pork butcher.

421
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:46,200
Ham, 79 francs. Spareribs, 45!

422
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:51,080
Now the cheese shop.
Picodons are 12.90, cabecous 23.50.

423
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:55,710
At the butcher's a baby's watching a dog
that's watching the chickens roasting.

424
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:59,170
Now we're at the newspaper kiosk
by the métro.

425
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:01,300
I'll leave you here. Bye.

426
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,060
"She can't relate to other people."

427
00:36:57,270 --> 00:37:00,150
"She was always a lonely child."

428
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:06,070
On a sparkling evening in July,

429
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:08,990
while on the beaches holidaymakers

430
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:11,620
relax in the new-found sun,

431
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:14,200
and in Paris the sweltering crowds

432
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,620
gaze at the first bursts

433
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:19,330
of the traditional fireworks,
Amélie Poulain,

434
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:23,130
godmother of outcasts,

435
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:25,670
Madonna of the unloved,

436
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,880
finally succumbs to exhaustion.

437
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,680
In Paris' grief-stricken streets,

438
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,560
a vast throng of mourners

439
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,730
line her funeral route in silence

440
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:43,230
with the measureless sorrow
of newly orphaned children.

441
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:46,400
What a strange destiny for one

442
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,860
who gave her all,

443
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:53,570
yet took such joy in life's simple pleasures.

444
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:57,240
Like Don Quixote, she pitted herself

445
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:00,460
against the grinding windmill
of all life's miseries.

446
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:14,970
It was a losing battle

447
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:17,010
that claimed her life too soon.

448
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,350
At barely 23, Amélie Poulain

449
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:23,020
let her young, tired body merge

450
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:26,480
with the ebb and flow of universal woe.

451
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:32,780
As she went, she felt a stab of regret
for letting her father die

452
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:36,410
without trying to give his stifled life

453
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:40,700
the breath of air she had given

454
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,830
to so many others.

455
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,140
Wait!

456
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,980
Wait!

457
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:10,900
Wait...

458
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,320
Wait, wait!

459
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:05,280
Pages full of dud ID photos
torn up and discarded by their owners,

460
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:09,000
carefully reassembled by some oddball.

461
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,120
Some family album!

462
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:17,880
A pack of Gauloises.

463
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:22,010
Just a second. It's so smoky in here.
Can you tell me where they are?

464
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:24,760
- I can't see a thing.
- More to the left.

465
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,430
- There?
- A bit more. There.

466
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:31,600
Thank you. You need change.

467
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:34,060
Forget it.

468
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:36,110
- Yes?
- A mauresque.

469
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:38,650
A mauresque for the young man.

470
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:42,110
One kir aligoté, one mauresque,
and two mint sodas.

471
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,450
Was that prenuptial or post-coital smooching?

472
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:47,580
Is your bullshit congenital?

473
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,660
- Prenuptial.
- Don't worry.

474
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,790
You'll find Mr. Right one day.

475
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,210
All women want to sleep on a man's shoulder.
All of them.

476
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:03,090
All men snore after a few drinks,
and I have a musical ear.

477
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:06,890
I had an operation on my nasal cavities.

478
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:09,010
I see you're a born romantic.

479
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:13,600
I see you've never known true love.

480
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,480
I did. It shortened my leg.

481
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:23,490
- I thought you fell off a horse.
- I did.

482
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:26,030
I was in love with a trapeze artist.

483
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:29,370
I should have known.
They always drop you at the last minute.

484
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:32,120
He dropped me just before my act.

485
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:37,830
It floored me. And the horse.

486
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,920
With me under it.

487
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,220
The mauresque?

488
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:48,220
Still, true love does exist.

489
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:52,180
I'm not saying it doesn't.
After 30 years behind this bar,

490
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:55,940
I'm an expert. I can even
give you the recipe.

491
00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:01,020
Take two regulars.

492
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:04,320
Let each think the other fancies them.
Leave it to simmer.

493
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,280
It never fails.

494
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:16,410
Excuse me!

495
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,210
Excuse me.

496
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:20,080
- I've had enough.
- I'll go.

497
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,800
Haven't you hurt enough people?

498
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,260
Gina can defend herself.

499
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:34,600
I don't mean Gina. I mean Georgette.

500
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:38,810
Georgette?

501
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:41,980
Open your eyes! She craves your attention

502
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:43,820
but you only have eyes for Gina.

503
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:49,410
Poor girl! The things she does

504
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:51,490
to catch your eye!

505
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,120
You really must be blind.

506
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,880
I'm off on a date. Bye!

507
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:09,050
Goodbye.

508
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:13,720
Whoever her new one is,

509
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,350
he can't be worse
than that nut with his tape recorder.

510
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,480
Joseph's not so nutty.

511
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,270
He's just in pain.

512
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:26,320
Come off it, Amélie.
They split up two months ago.

513
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:29,650
To keep on coming here every day,
he must be a masochist.

514
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,740
Don't say you haven't noticed.

515
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:35,620
Noticed what?

516
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,580
He always sits here, right?

517
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:40,160
Yes.

518
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:41,580
Sit down.

519
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:43,880
Sit down, Georgette.

520
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:49,300
- What can you see?
- My cigarette counter.

521
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:52,550
And nothing's missing?

522
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:53,590
No.

523
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,220
Make an effort.

524
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:05,110
I don't get it!

525
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:08,780
I'll leave you to think about it. Good night.

526
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,380
Good morning.

527
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:31,920
Letter Arrives 30 Years Late.

528
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:38,640
A mailbag found by climbers on a glacier
on Mont Blanc was part of a cargo

529
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:42,270
lost in a plane crash in the late 1960s.

530
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:46,810
So sad! A young, pretty princess for once.

531
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:49,280
Would it be less sad if
she were old and ugly?

532
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,530
Of course. Look at Mother Teresa.

533
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,950
Is he still chasing Gina?

534
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:58,240
No, he's after somebody else now.

535
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:02,660
- Anyone I know?
- Yes.

536
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:05,120
Funny about this glacier.

537
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:08,040
Somebody at The Two Windmills?

538
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:10,210
Not you, surely!

539
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:11,460
No.

540
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:15,470
Not Suzanne.

541
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:17,470
Surely not!

542
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:19,220
Yes.

543
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:26,440
- Look. There he is again.
- How strange.

544
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,860
- And here.
- Him again.

545
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,480
"Gare de Lyon."

546
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,400
And here.

547
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:36,110
"March 5th, Austerlitz."

548
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:40,080
Always the same blank expression.

549
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,660
Twelve times.

550
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,670
I counted.

551
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:47,040
It's very odd.

552
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:52,050
Why keep taking your picture all over town
only to throw them away?

553
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:54,920
Good ones, too.

554
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:57,840
It's like a sort of ritual.

555
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:00,100
Maybe he's so terrified

556
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:03,520
of growing old, it's his only consolation.

557
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:06,640
He's dead.

558
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:08,940
Dead?

559
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:11,820
Yes. He's scared of being forgotten.

560
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:16,070
So he uses the photo booths
to remind people what he looks like.

561
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:20,530
Like faxing his portrait from the afterlife.

562
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:24,580
A dead man who's scared of being forgotten.

563
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:27,830
At least these guys here have made it.

564
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:30,000
They're long dead,

565
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:33,960
but they'll never be forgotten.

566
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,760
- The girl with the glass...
- Yes.

567
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,180
Maybe she's distracted
because she's thinking about someone.

568
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,140
Somebody in the picture?

569
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:46,810
No.

570
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:49,560
More likely a boy she saw somewhere,

571
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,020
and felt an affinity with.

572
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:59,240
You mean, she'd rather imagine herself
relating to someone who's absent

573
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,990
than build relationships
with those around her?

574
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:07,580
No.

575
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:11,790
Maybe she tries hard
to fix other people's messy lives.

576
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:13,790
What about her?

577
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:16,800
And her own messy life?

578
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,380
Who'll fix that?

579
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:25,600
It's better to help people
than a garden gnome.

580
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:42,590
The driver had 2.8g of alcohol in his blood!

581
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:44,090
Makes me sick!

582
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:47,100

No radar will ever catch him
while he's working, will it?

587
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:01,190
You shouldn't do that, Mr. Collignon.

588
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,150
It's not his fault.

589
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,950
True, Mrs. Cauchoix!

590
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:08,990
It's not his fault he can't
sleep. It's Lady Di's.

591
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:15,120
Guess what I found in the truck.
A lingerie catalogue.

592
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:19,630
He'd pasted Lady Di's face over the model's.

593
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:23,340
What today? Five asparagus,

594
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:25,340

595
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:26,680
Nothing.

The migraine seems to be better.

599

Yes, but my sciatica kept me awake all night.

600

- It's ages since I saw you looking so good.
- Really?

601

A woman without love
withers like a flower without sun.

602
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,600
Strange weather today.

603
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,310
What's so funny?

604
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:20,690
Everyone who's come in today
has given us a weather report.

605
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:24,030
We pass the time of day
to forget how time passes.

We do it to keep us from talking crap.

607

I write crap but nobody wants to publish it.

608
00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:31,950
- Another rejection?
- My thirtieth.

609

Isn't your cousin a book critic?

610
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:37,500
Forget it! Critics are like leeches

611
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:40,830

612
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,380
Is your book a love story?

613
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:47,550
No, it's about a guy who keeps a journal.

614
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:49,930
Not about what's happened to him,

615
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:52,760
but disasters that might
happen in the future.

616
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:58,140

00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:02,980
I'll dedicate the manuscript to you.

00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:01,490
Pretty much.

I feel a change.

636
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:11,710
I had two heart attacks
and had to have an abortion

637
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:14,210
because I did crack while I was pregnant.

Very good!

709
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:10,510
Collignon...

710
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:14,680
- Collignon, big moron, down the john!
- That's it!

711
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:24,690
OK! That's enough for today.

712
01:03:24,730 --> 01:03:26,730
Enough! Enough!

713
01:03:26,770 --> 01:03:29,730
Lucien, stop!

714
01:03:29,770 --> 01:03:31,530
Very good.

715
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:36,570
Mr. Dufayel, I found this under your mat.

716
01:04:53,610 --> 01:04:55,650
Still no win!

717
01:04:55,690 --> 01:04:57,780
Me neither.

718
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:01,870
May I?

719
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,290
There's a little...

720
01:05:11,130 --> 01:05:12,380
You're gorgeous

721
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:14,130
when you blush.

722
01:05:15,170 --> 01:05:17,550
Like a wild flower.

723
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:20,930
It's my dyspepsia.

724
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:23,640
Morning, all.

725
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:26,390
Beautiful day.

726
01:05:45,450 --> 01:05:47,200
Pack of Gitanes, please.

727
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:51,170
Bravo! Vive la France! You scalded me.

728
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:55,630
Bravo! Ten out of ten! Bull's-eye!

729
01:05:59,630 --> 01:06:01,800
It was Amélie. She...

730
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:39,800
Do you know what happened
when they went up Mont Blanc?

731
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:42,300
The silicon in her face froze up.

732
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:46,850
Her face was a festering mass!

733
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:16,500
Mulled wine and ginger biscuits.

734
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:19,210
Thank you.

735
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:22,460
I was too hard the other day
on the girl with the glass.

736
01:07:23,510 --> 01:07:27,470
Tell me about that boy she saw.
Did they meet again?

737
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:30,060
No.

738
01:07:31,270 --> 01:07:32,930
They're into different things.

739
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:36,560
Luck is like the Tour de France.

740
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:38,690
You wait, and it flashes past you.

741
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:44,240
You have to catch it while you can.

742
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,390
Can I help you?

743
01:08:10,430 --> 01:08:13,600
Excuse me.
I found this album in the street and I...

744
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:18,230
Nino will be so pleased!
He was so sad the other day.

745
01:08:18,270 --> 01:08:20,230
I almost prayed to St Anthony.

746
01:08:21,770 --> 01:08:23,980
Is... Nino there?

747
01:08:24,030 --> 01:08:26,820
No. On Wednesdays he works at the funfair.

748
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:31,240
How long has he had this collection?

749
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:35,750
Since I got him the job here, last year.

750
01:08:35,790 --> 01:08:40,000
Before, he collected footprints.
He worked nights.

751
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:46,010
In the daytime
he took pictures of footprints in wet cement.

752
01:08:46,050 --> 01:08:48,220
He's a funny guy.

753
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:50,550
When we met, he was a Santa Claus.

754
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:55,470
Other things like...

755
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:59,390
Whenever he heard a funny
laugh, he'd tape it.

756
01:09:03,570 --> 01:09:04,610
Really?

757
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:09,070
Must be hard for his girlfriend.

758
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:11,450
He never keeps them long.

759
01:09:11,490 --> 01:09:14,280
Times are hard for dreamers.

760
01:09:14,330 --> 01:09:17,120
Eva! Where are those coffees?

761
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:19,620
I'd better go. Thanks for the album.

762
01:09:19,670 --> 01:09:23,340
It's OK. I've got time to
take it to the funfair.

763
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:27,840
Suit yourself. The ghost train.
Ask for Nino Quincampoix, like the street.

764
01:09:52,110 --> 01:09:54,240
I'm looking for Nino. Is he here?

765
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:56,370
He doesn't get off till seven.

766
01:09:57,910 --> 01:10:00,330
- Is there no way to see him before?
- Sure.

767
01:10:01,670 --> 01:10:03,250
20 francs.

768
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:15,820
See you next Wednesday.

769
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:31,960
5pm tomorrow, Montmartre carousel
near the phone box. Bring a 5 franc piece.

770
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:52,190
Want to know about her?

771
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:57,660
- You know her? You saw her?
- You bet.

772
01:11:57,740 --> 01:11:59,700
She put us in her shirt pocket.

773
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:02,330
Next to her breast.

774
01:12:02,410 --> 01:12:04,290
Is she pretty?

775
01:12:04,370 --> 01:12:06,290
Not bad.

776
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:09,380
- Beautiful.
- No, pretty.

777
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:10,750
- Beautiful.
- Pretty.

778
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:14,630
- What does she want from you?
- She's broke.

779
01:12:14,710 --> 01:12:17,380
She wants a reward for the album.

780
01:12:17,470 --> 01:12:19,720
Or she collects photos, too.

781
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:24,100
She wants to trade us
for a one-eyed man with glasses!

782
01:12:28,770 --> 01:12:29,770
No, you dope!

783
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,690
She's in love.

784
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:36,530
- I don't even know her.
- Yes, you do.

785
01:12:36,570 --> 01:12:38,360
Since when?

786
01:12:38,450 --> 01:12:40,160
You've always known her.

787
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:41,490
In your dreams.

788
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:56,010
Hello?

789
01:12:56,090 --> 01:13:00,140
Yes. You! Man with the
plastic bag! It's for you.

790
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:03,180
- Me?
- Yes.

791
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:07,520
Thank you.

792
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:10,520
Hello?

793
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:13,360
Follow the blue arrows, Mr. Quincampoix.

794
01:14:38,650 --> 01:14:43,110
When the finger's pointing to the sky,
only a fool looks at the finger.

795
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:56,640
Hello?

796
01:15:57,730 --> 01:16:00,060
I know the stranger in the pictures.

797
01:16:00,110 --> 01:16:04,190
He's a ghost. He's invisible,
Mr. Quincampoix.

798
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:07,610
He only appears when the film is developed.

799
01:16:07,660 --> 01:16:11,030
When a girl has her photo taken,

800
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:17,040
he goes "Oooh!" in her ear,
while he gently caresses her neck.

801
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:19,630
That's how he got caught, Mr. Quincampoix.

802
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:24,670
Who are you?

803
01:16:24,710 --> 01:16:26,170
Page 51.

804
01:16:34,770 --> 01:16:36,350
[DO YOU

805
01:16:36,390 --> 01:16:38,230
WANT

806
01:16:38,270 --> 01:16:40,730
TO MEET ME?]

807
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:21,580
Listen to this. "A boy of six,

808
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:23,790
while his parents sleep, drives off

809
01:18:23,830 --> 01:18:25,590
in a pedal car.

810
01:18:25,630 --> 01:18:29,340
Found on a motorway
near Münster in Germany,

811
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:32,970
he told the police he
wanted to see the stars."

812
01:18:33,010 --> 01:18:36,680
Isn't life beautiful, eh?

813
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:41,310
Love. The only bug she hadn't caught!

814
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:44,400
- Nobody's immune.
- At least it gives me a break.

815
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:46,650
Love's a great beautician.

816
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:52,320
What's she like? Tall? Small? Blonde? Dark?

817
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:56,820
Let's say... average height.

818
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:01,120
Not a dwarf or a giraffe. Normal.

819
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:04,750
Pretty, for her type.

820
01:19:04,790 --> 01:19:07,130
As for blonde or dark...

821
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:11,800
...it's hard to say,
but she wasn't a redhead.

822
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,720
- Unless...
- Forget it.

823
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:19,720
I do remember she casually asked
if you had a girlfriend.

824
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:20,810
And?

825
01:19:20,850 --> 01:19:23,310
I said you weren't interested, right?

826
01:19:24,730 --> 01:19:26,230
You didn't!

827
01:19:26,270 --> 01:19:28,520
What do you care? You don't even know her.

828
01:19:29,570 --> 01:19:33,780
- Exactly. It's the mystery.
- You won't find mystery here.

829
01:19:33,820 --> 01:19:36,030
A pound of nectarines, please.

830
01:19:36,070 --> 01:19:38,910
These ones here are the prettiest.

831
01:19:38,950 --> 01:19:41,080
Trust him. He's an artist!

832
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:44,210
He's been going home every night
with tons of unsold stock.

833
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:47,420
What for? Is he stewing a pig?

834
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:49,630
No, sir! He's studying art!

835
01:19:49,670 --> 01:19:53,380
He sells leeks all day long
and paints turnips all night!

836
01:19:53,420 --> 01:19:55,510
The boy's a useless vegetable.

837
01:19:55,550 --> 01:19:57,050
A good prompter

838
01:19:57,090 --> 01:20:00,680
in each cellar window
whispering cutting retorts

839
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:03,350
would mean shy people had the last laugh.

840
01:20:03,390 --> 01:20:05,850
At least you'll never be a vegetable.

841
01:20:05,890 --> 01:20:08,150
Even artichokes

842
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:09,230
have hearts.

843
01:20:12,230 --> 01:20:15,860
You'll never be a vegetable.
Even artichokes have hearts!

844
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:58,900
Memory seven.

845
01:21:16,590 --> 01:21:20,840
Darling Mado,
I miss you more and more each day.

846
01:21:20,890 --> 01:21:24,180
I'm an exile in a world of dreary khaki.

847
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:26,520
I can't sleep, can't eat...

848
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:29,270
This camp was the biggest mistake of my life,

849
01:21:29,310 --> 01:21:33,110
depriving me of my beloved
for five long weeks.

850
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:36,030
I think of you endlessly. Your Adrien.

851
01:21:37,780 --> 01:21:42,570
I turned down my last month's wages
instead of giving notice.

852
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:46,950
I dream of better times ahead.

853
01:21:46,990 --> 01:21:51,000
An orange-colored day. Remember, my love?

854
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:53,130
Your ever-loving Adrien.

855
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:56,340
Good news, darling Mado.

856
01:21:56,380 --> 01:21:59,720
Soon I'll be able to afford a car

857
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:02,260
and drive home every night.

858
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:06,720
Till then, meet me on
Friday and we'll go out.

859

01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:04,440
Hello? Hello?

862
01:25:33,180 --> 01:25:35,640
[WHERE & WHEN?]

863
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:47,820
One hour later at 11 Boulevard St Martin,

864
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:51,490
Amélie walks into a party goods
and costume shop.

865
01:25:52,530 --> 01:25:56,990
At the same time,
a man leaves his home at 108 Rue Lecourbe.

866
01:25:58,950 --> 01:26:02,710
26 minutes later, Amélie is at the
photo booth at the Gare de l'Est.

867
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:11,050
Simultaneously,
the man in red shoes parks outside.

868
01:26:11,090 --> 01:26:14,470
The time is exactly 11:40.

869
01:27:00,140 --> 01:27:02,180
At this precise moment,

870
01:27:02,270 --> 01:27:06,980
only Amélie has the key
to the riddle of the mystery man.

871
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:13,570
How's it going, Mrs. Wells?

872
01:27:13,650 --> 01:27:16,490
It's always better when it's not raining.

873
01:27:16,530 --> 01:27:18,950
- This is for you.
- Me?

874
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:32,590
Dear Mrs. Wells,
We recently recovered a mailbag

875
01:27:32,670 --> 01:27:34,720
that was lost in a plane crash

876
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:38,430
on October 12th 1969 on Mont Blanc.

01:27:38,510 --> 01:27:42,970
We are forwarding the enclosed letter
to your address.

878
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:47,150
Please accept our apologies
for the uncustomary delay.

I can't sleep, can't eat.

881

I think of you endlessly.

882
01:27:57,410 --> 01:28:01,240
I know I've made
the biggest mistake of my life.

883
01:28:01,330 --> 01:28:04,000
I turned down that woman's money.

884

If all goes well,
I'll soon be able to afford a house.

885
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:12,090
I dream of better times ahead

886
01:28:12,170 --> 01:28:16,010
when you'll forgive me and join me here

887
01:28:16,090 --> 01:28:19,430
one orange-colored day.
Your ever-loving Adrien.

888
01:28:49,290 --> 01:28:51,420
Mr. Dufayel, another package for you.

889
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:04,510
Mr. Dufayel, do you know
what happened to the concierge?

890
01:29:05,930 --> 01:29:07,270
She got a letter.

891
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:11,150
From her husband. 40 years late.

892
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:15,530
That's a lot, isn't it, Mr. Dufayel?

893
01:29:28,790 --> 01:29:32,210
I'm not big on still life, Mr. Dufayel.

894
01:29:32,290 --> 01:29:35,300
Then work on your thin layer.

895
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:38,090
Fat over thin. Always!

896
01:29:56,940 --> 01:29:58,740
- Mr. Dufayel...
- Yes!

897
01:29:58,780 --> 01:30:03,160
The papers said
that there'll soon be a new star.

898
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:10,330
- So you're into stars now?
- I saw it on TV at my mum's, that's why.

899
01:30:12,170 --> 01:30:13,920
I don't know if it's true.

900
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:16,250
In America

901
01:30:16,340 --> 01:30:19,630
they're going to take all
the rich people's ashes,

902
01:30:19,670 --> 01:30:22,340
put them in a satellite

903
01:30:22,380 --> 01:30:24,680
and shoot it into space.

904
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:27,140
The satellite's going to shine forever.

905
01:30:31,770 --> 01:30:33,310
And Lady Di...

906
01:30:33,350 --> 01:30:35,610
Will they do the same for her?

907
01:30:35,650 --> 01:30:36,650
Lady Di, Lady Di!

908
01:30:36,730 --> 01:30:37,980
Give it a rest!

909
01:30:38,020 --> 01:30:40,780
I can't concentrate.

910
01:30:42,950 --> 01:30:43,950
Lady Di!

911
01:30:45,070 --> 01:30:46,070
Lady Di!

912
01:30:47,330 --> 01:30:48,370
Renoir.

913
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:30,720
Morning, sir.

914
01:32:47,450 --> 01:32:48,490
Cambodia.

915
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:55,830
I don't understand.

916
01:32:55,870 --> 01:32:59,750
Brilliant! You couldn't have done better.

917
01:32:59,790 --> 01:33:03,000
- Did it work?
- It's getting there.

918
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:05,960
Ask me again any time. The harm's done.

919
01:33:06,010 --> 01:33:09,680
- What do you mean?
- Everybody calls me Snow White!

920
01:34:15,410 --> 01:34:18,240
[The Two Windmills café from 4pm.]

921
01:34:24,750 --> 01:34:26,670
- Eva?
- Yes?

922
01:34:26,710 --> 01:34:30,460
Could you stand in for me at four?

923
01:34:30,510 --> 01:34:32,430
Again?

924
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:37,220
Close the door!

925
01:34:39,390 --> 01:34:41,390
What's up with him?

926
01:34:41,430 --> 01:34:43,190
Is he sulking?

927
01:34:43,230 --> 01:34:46,810
- He thinks I smile too much.
- He'd rather you frowned?

928
01:34:46,860 --> 01:34:49,780
With other men, yes.

929
01:34:52,490 --> 01:34:56,910
Nino is late. Amélie can only think
of two possible explanations.

930
01:34:56,950 --> 01:34:59,040
Firstly, that he didn't find the photo.

931
01:35:00,870 --> 01:35:03,330
Secondly, before he could assemble it,

932
01:35:03,370 --> 01:35:07,670
a gang of bank robbers took him hostage.

933
01:35:07,710 --> 01:35:09,710
The cops gave chase.

934
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:11,550
They got away,

935
01:35:11,590 --> 01:35:14,340
but he caused a crash.

936
01:35:14,380 --> 01:35:16,590
When he came to,

937
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:18,300
he'd lost his memory,

938
01:35:20,180 --> 01:35:22,060
An ex-con picked him up,

939
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:26,310
mistook him for a fugitive,
and shipped him to Istanbul.

940
01:35:27,270 --> 01:35:29,520
He met some Afghan raiders,

941
01:35:29,570 --> 01:35:33,150
who took him to steal
some Russian warheads.

942
01:35:36,780 --> 01:35:40,620
But their truck hit a mine
at the border with Tajikistan.

943
01:35:40,660 --> 01:35:46,170
He survived, took to the hills,
and became a Mujaheddin.

944
01:35:46,210 --> 01:35:49,170
Amélie refuses to get upset for a guy

945
01:35:49,210 --> 01:35:53,800
who'll eat borscht all his life
in a hat like a tea cosy.

946
01:36:13,030 --> 01:36:15,240
- What can I get you?
- A coffee, please.

947
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:18,200
A coffee.

948
01:36:40,220 --> 01:36:41,680
Here's your coffee.

949
01:36:43,220 --> 01:36:44,270
Thank you.

950
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:10,290
[Today's menu]

951
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:20,760
He's understood.

952
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:24,010
He's going to put his teaspoon down,

953
01:37:25,430 --> 01:37:29,020
dip his finger in the sugar,

954
01:37:33,770 --> 01:37:36,480
turn around slowly,

955
01:37:36,530 --> 01:37:38,610
and speak to me.

956
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:46,200
Excuse me.

957
01:37:47,700 --> 01:37:48,950
Is this you?

958
01:37:55,420 --> 01:37:56,670
Yes, it's you.

959
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:19,440
I'll take that.

960
01:38:21,860 --> 01:38:23,530
Another coffee?

961
01:38:23,570 --> 01:38:25,700
- No, thanks. I'm fine.
- OK.

962
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:50,720
So it's this man here,
the one with his hand up?

963
01:38:51,980 --> 01:38:53,020
Yes.

964
01:38:55,350 --> 01:38:58,230
Is she in love with him?

965
01:39:01,030 --> 01:39:02,070
Yes.

966
01:39:03,990 --> 01:39:07,370
I think it's time she took a real risk.

967
01:39:07,410 --> 01:39:11,910
She might just do that.
She's devising a stratagem.

968
01:39:11,950 --> 01:39:15,620
She's fond of stratagems.

969
01:39:17,670 --> 01:39:18,710
Yes.

970
01:39:20,420 --> 01:39:22,550
In fact, she's cowardly.

971
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:27,300
That's why I can't capture her look.

972
01:39:29,140 --> 01:39:34,640
Dufayel's attempts to meddle are intolerable!

973
01:39:37,150 --> 01:39:43,110
If Amélie chooses to live in a dream

974
01:39:43,150 --> 01:39:47,360
and remain an introverted young woman,

975
01:39:47,410 --> 01:39:52,080
she has an absolute right
to mess up her life!

976
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:28,570
What are you doing, Mr. Dufayel?

977
01:40:30,950 --> 01:40:33,080
Tell me, Lucien.

978
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:38,000
For deliveries,
do you keep keys to all the apartments?

979
01:40:50,470 --> 01:40:54,350
One of your booths is out of order.

980
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:59,020
It seems to be jammed.

981
01:41:00,150 --> 01:41:02,440
Gare de l'Est ticket hall.

982
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:07,650
- Buy a video, get one free.
- No, thanks.

983
01:41:14,410 --> 01:41:16,080
Sam?

984
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:18,160
Samantha?

985
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:22,540
Samantha?

986
01:41:27,460 --> 01:41:29,380
Can you stand in for me at...

987
01:41:51,860 --> 01:41:55,490
Photo booth, Gare de l'Est ticket hall,
Tuesday 5pm.

988
01:41:55,580 --> 01:41:58,870
[Can you stand in for me this afternoon?]

989
01:43:10,150 --> 01:43:11,440
Almost done.

990
01:43:16,620 --> 01:43:20,660
The mystery man wasn't a ghost
or a man scared of ageing,

991
01:43:20,700 --> 01:43:22,750
but simply the repairman,

992
01:43:22,830 --> 01:43:25,290
a normal guy doing his job.

993
01:43:27,420 --> 01:43:29,040
Sorry.

994
01:44:14,710 --> 01:44:18,050
He keeps spying on me!
It's making me sick.

995
01:44:18,130 --> 01:44:21,550
4:05: Blatant female conspiracy.

996
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:26,020
Gosh, you're tense, Georgette!

997
01:44:27,100 --> 01:44:28,650
Good luck. You'll need it.

998
01:44:34,070 --> 01:44:38,610
Excuse me. Did you put this in my pocket?

999
01:44:38,700 --> 01:44:42,120
- Yes, but I'm not the one...
- I know. Where is she?

1000
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:43,700
She's at her father's.

1001
01:44:43,740 --> 01:44:49,170
It's awkward. I'd like to speak to
you, but... I finish work at six.

1002
01:44:49,210 --> 01:44:51,170
- Can you come back?
- OK.

1003
01:44:52,210 --> 01:44:53,290
See you later.

1004
01:44:53,340 --> 01:44:56,920
4:08: Docking scheduled.

1005
01:45:28,750 --> 01:45:33,420
The blond guy in a camel coat.
He's very absent-minded, too.

1006
01:45:33,460 --> 01:45:35,210
How come?

1007
01:45:36,250 --> 01:45:38,720
He came back three times the same afternoon.

1008
01:45:39,970 --> 01:45:41,220
1:12:

1009
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:42,550
Camel coat.

1010
01:45:42,640 --> 01:45:43,890
2:50:

1011
01:45:43,930 --> 01:45:45,760
Camel coat.

1012
01:45:45,810 --> 01:45:48,020
- 4:17: Camel coat.
- Stop it!

1013
01:45:49,060 --> 01:45:52,270
My rash has come back! Look, Suzanne!

1014
01:45:52,310 --> 01:45:56,020
My rash is back. He's driving me nuts.

1015
01:45:56,070 --> 01:45:58,230
Lay off!

1016
01:45:58,280 --> 01:46:02,570
If she had a clear conscience,
she wouldn't be in such a state.

1017
01:46:02,610 --> 01:46:04,570
I've had it. I'm going home.

1018
01:46:04,620 --> 01:46:08,120
Psychos are the last straw!

1019
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:11,540
Georgette! Georg...

1020
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:15,880
Stop smothering them!
Women need to breathe.

1021
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:19,210
You let them breathe,
they want a change of air.

1022
01:46:19,260 --> 01:46:21,130
Fresh air's healthy.

1023
01:46:21,170 --> 01:46:23,180
Shut it, failure!

1024
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:27,430
Failed writer, failed life...

1025
01:46:27,470 --> 01:46:30,060
I love the word "fail".

1026
01:46:30,100 --> 01:46:32,140
Failure is human destiny.

1027
01:46:32,190 --> 01:46:33,770
It's gasbag time!

1028
01:46:33,810 --> 01:46:37,070
Failure teaches us that life is but a draft,

1029
01:46:37,110 --> 01:46:40,990
a long rehearsal for a
show that will never play.

1030
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:44,740
I bet he stole that.

1031
01:46:44,780 --> 01:46:47,280
I do have some original ideas,

1032
01:46:47,330 --> 01:46:52,790
but people always steal them.
A bit like your women.

1033
01:46:52,830 --> 01:46:54,870
Meaning?

1034
01:46:54,920 --> 01:46:58,130
Meaning you'd better get used to it.

1035
01:46:58,170 --> 01:47:00,710
Speak for yourself, you...

1036
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:01,800
What?

1037
01:47:05,550 --> 01:47:08,680
- What's going on?
- Nothing much. Georgette went out.

1038
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:10,470
Joseph got mad.

1039
01:47:10,520 --> 01:47:12,020
"Went out?"

1040
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:17,270
Just like Gina. You know who's she's with?
The guy with the plastic bag.

1041
01:47:18,980 --> 01:47:21,360
I saw their little game.

1042
01:47:21,400 --> 01:47:23,740
The note in the coat pocket,

1043
01:47:23,780 --> 01:47:25,410
4:08.

1044
01:47:25,450 --> 01:47:29,410
Back he comes, and hey presto!
Out they go.

1045
01:47:33,330 --> 01:47:37,000
- I'm worried for Amélie because I like you.
- What do you mean?

1046
01:47:38,040 --> 01:47:41,840
By and large, the men I like
are mentally unsound.

1047
01:47:41,880 --> 01:47:44,920
- I'd like to know more about you.
- Ask me questions.

1048
01:47:47,720 --> 01:47:49,510
One swallow doesn't make...?

1049
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:51,640
A swallow?

1050
01:47:53,220 --> 01:47:54,770
A summer.

1051
01:47:54,810 --> 01:47:56,190
And clothes...?

1052
01:47:56,230 --> 01:47:57,770
The man.

1053
01:47:57,810 --> 01:47:59,230
- A good cat deserves...?
- A rat.

1054
01:47:59,270 --> 01:48:00,940
- Patience...?
- Is a virtue.

1055
01:48:00,980 --> 01:48:02,570
- Rolling stone...?
- Gathers no moss.

1056
01:48:02,610 --> 01:48:04,940
- It's a sin...?
- To steal a pin.

1057
01:48:04,990 --> 01:48:06,990
Absence makes...?

1058
01:48:07,030 --> 01:48:08,490
The heart grow fonder.

1059
01:48:08,530 --> 01:48:10,530
- Not bad.
- You collect them?

1060
01:48:10,580 --> 01:48:14,910
In my family, we say a man
who knows his proverbs can't be all bad.

1061
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:22,960
Pretty girl from the 5th
floor, listen to this!

1062
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,970
- Do you believe in miracles?
- Not today.

1063
01:48:27,380 --> 01:48:29,550
You're in for a surprise.

1064
01:48:29,590 --> 01:48:32,930
What if I told you that a team of climbers

1065
01:48:32,970 --> 01:48:36,930
on Mont Blanc had found

1066
01:48:36,980 --> 01:48:41,610
hard proof that my husband loved me?

1067
01:49:14,970 --> 01:49:17,100
Lucien, I need some yeast.

1068
01:49:17,140 --> 01:49:21,060
For Miss Amélie?
She's baking her famous plum cake?

1069
01:49:21,100 --> 01:49:24,070
Collignon! Go and get the yeast.

1070
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:19,870
Amélie?

1071
01:50:19,910 --> 01:50:20,960
Amélie?

1072
01:50:28,300 --> 01:50:29,340
Amélie?

1073
01:50:51,190 --> 01:50:52,240
[I'll be back]

1074
01:51:23,310 --> 01:51:26,310
Go into the bedroom, Miss Poulain.

1075
01:51:42,370 --> 01:51:45,500
So, little Amélie,

1076
01:51:45,540 --> 01:51:49,630
your bones aren't made of glass.

1077
01:51:49,670 --> 01:51:52,800
You can take life's knocks.

1078
01:51:52,840 --> 01:51:57,220
If you let this chance go by,

1079
01:51:57,260 --> 01:52:03,930
eventually your heart will become

1080
01:52:03,970 --> 01:52:10,020
as dry and brittle as my skeleton.

1081
01:52:11,650 --> 01:52:13,190
So...

1082
01:52:13,230 --> 01:52:16,400
Go and get him, for pete's sake!

1083
01:55:03,900 --> 01:55:09,740
[Without you, today's emotions
would be the scurf of yesterday's]

1084
01:56:06,050 --> 01:56:07,760
International airport.

1085
01:56:07,800 --> 01:56:12,850
September 28th 1997. It is exactly 11am.

1086
01:56:12,890 --> 01:56:15,600
At the funfair, near the ghost train,

1087
01:56:15,640 --> 01:56:18,810
the marshmallow twister is twisting.

1088
01:56:18,850 --> 01:56:21,150
Meanwhile, on a bench in Villette Square,

1089
01:56:21,190 --> 01:56:26,650
Félix Lerbier learns there are more links
in his brain than atoms in the universe.

1090
01:56:27,740 --> 01:56:28,860
Meanwhile,

1091
01:56:28,910 --> 01:56:32,580
at the Sacré Cœur,
the nuns are practicing their backhand.

1092
01:56:32,660 --> 01:56:35,040
The temperature is 24°C,

1093
01:56:35,080 --> 01:56:36,960
humidity 70%,

1094
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:40,250
atmospheric pressure 999 millibars.
