00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:44,501
APRIL 1979 - WESTERN SAHARA
NEAR BIR ANZARANE

2
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,214
Is your mum home?

3
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,926
Are you ready?

4
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,848
Time to go now.

5
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,235
Jesus, the Son of God,

6
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:21,950
came down to Earth and suffered
to atone for your sins.

7
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,483
You're in trouble too.

8
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,485
I don't mind if you're around.

9
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,654
The same boy, 30 years on...

10
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,865
I didn't thank you for what you did.

11
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,243
You showed a lot of guts.

12
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,828
You looked good, awfully good.

13
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,498
I guess I'm in love with you.

14
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:15,087
- You'll come to the police?
- I can't.

15
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,005
Why not?

16
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,133
What if I said I killed Sean Regan?

17
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,136
You'd tell the police that?

18
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,180
If you take me there.

19
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,767
I'm not going to.

20
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:32,896
Look, angel, I'm tired.
My jaw hurts and my ribs ache.

21
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:37,359
I killed a man back there and stood by
while some kid was killed.

22
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:40,988
All because Geiger
tried to throw a loop over Carmen?

23
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:45,242
The cops would swarm
your house so fast

24
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,620
the place would look
like a police convention.

25
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,778
Maybe they can cure her again.

26
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:27,075
We'll tell your father about Regan.
He can take it.

27
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,994
You forget one thing.

28
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,747
Me.

29
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,583
What's wrong with you?

30
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,294
Nothing you can't fix.

31
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:20,504
MICMACS

32
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,353
If I operate,
he could become a vegetable.

33
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,441
If I don't, he could die any second.

34
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:28,363
Better to live and risk sudden death
than live with no idea you're alive.

35
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:31,408
You should have studied philosophy.

36
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,910
Anyone got a coin?

37
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,497
Heads.

38
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:42,002
OK, leave it in.
He'll drive airport security wild.

39
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,483
They changed the lock.

40
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:08,111
Good Lord,
they did a hatchet job on your hair!

41
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,988
Where's my stuff?

42
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,449
I put it in the basement

43
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:16,286
but folks only left a few odd socks.

44
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:25,921
That's my hat.

45
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,367
Bazil!

46
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,952
Bazil, dear!

47
00:08:57,078 --> 00:09:01,248
For you. It fell off the truck.
100% cotton.

48
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:05,293
You have work.
You'll soon find a place.

49
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,801
Is Serge here?

50
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,887
Hey, Bazil!
That was a pretty close call.

51
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:20,684
- I nearly died.
- Still, I hope you're bullet-proof now.

52
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,019
Here I am... Loyal to my post.

53
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:26,189
Your post's here
but maybe it's not so loyal.

54
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,691
I had to replace you.

55
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:31,236
Meet Lola.

56
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,196
She's on a 3-month try-out.

57
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:36,241
An open-ended contract.

58
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:39,744
Let's not get emotional.
See you around.

59
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,715
Mr Bazil! Ignore him.

60
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,843
I have a boyfriend.
His name's Ricardo.

61
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:58,930
Ricardo picks me up every night
on his motorbike.

62
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,640
He parks right there

63
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,351
where you got shot.

64
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,020
One day, heading home...

65
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:10,609
we heard this sound
like a stone caught in the tire.

66
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,697
Mr Bazil, it wasn't a stone.

67
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,366
Pick a hand.

68
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,038
Make an effort.

69
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:36,635
With her head under her toes,
and her feet in her nose

70
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:40,138
Between the sheets,
she does such feats

71
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:43,975
She goes into a spin,
looking mighty thin

72
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,936
Then without a care,
her legs in her hair

73
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:51,900
She rolls up, the tease,
and nibbles her knees

74
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:55,278
That elastic gal

75
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:58,782
You can go wild with her, pal

76
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,327
Sweeter than a femme fatale

77
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:06,414
She's quite a sight,
twisting left and right

78
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,126
That elastic gal

79
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,857
Got a sec?

80
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,404
I spent 3/4 of my life in jail.

81
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,406
My friends call me Slammer.

82
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,158
I'm Bazil.

83
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:50,662
I know. You have a slug
in your brain-box.

84
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:54,290
You've been on the street two months,
getting by.

85
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,502
People who stay on track have a goal.
What's yours?

86
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,587
I live day to day.

87
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:03,091
The bullet could make my brain pop
any second.

88
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:06,678
The widow-maker jammed on me.

89
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,305
The guillotine, back in '59.

90
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:12,809
The blade got stuck
and just nicked my hide.

91
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,728
It only ever happened twice.
I was pardoned.

92
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,939
You need to get that bullet out.

93
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:23,027
Can't, the surgeon said so...

94
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:27,031
Follow me.
I know a family who'll adopt you.

95
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,227
That's Max. This is his yard.

96
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:59,522
In return,
we guard the temple at night.

97
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,900
If thieves show up...

98
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,865
Go on in, kid.

99
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,594
Come on, don't be shy.

100
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,154
Let me introduce you.

101
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:52,158
She decides whom we recruit.

102
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:56,537
- So, stray bullets come your way?
- Yes, ma'am.

103
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,915
The name's Mama Chow.

104
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,293
Here, we salvage gear,
sort it and fix it.

105
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,504
Everyone pitches in.

106
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,172
Even Tiny Pete.

107
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:09,717
Even though he's a real artist.

108
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:20,812
We bring him anything he can use.

109
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,477
59...

110
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,479
42...

111
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,148
104...

112
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,985
Spot on!

113
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:12,655
Calculator. Her dad was a surveyor,
her mum a seamstress.

114
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:15,158
She can eye you and size you.

115
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,576
"Eye you and size you."

116
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,454
A white man eyes you
and sizes you,

117
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:23,124
he's no pushover, gets in a tizzy
and changes like the weather.

118
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,169
"Eyes you and sizes you."
Note taken.

119
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,379
He was an ethnographer in Congo.

120
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,131
Buster...

121
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,299
That's my name.

122
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,510
I have carbon fibre staples
in my lungs.

123
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:39,265
He burst a lung in a hot-water bottle
exploding contest.

124
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:42,560
Plus a dynamo in my stomach,
iron filings in my gut

125
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:45,188
and a titanium tube in my neck.

126
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,356
Go on, hit me there.

127
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,983
Hit me, it's titanium!

128
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,526
- Hit him!
- Go on!

129
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,073
His goal
is the Guinness Book of Records.

130
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,366
I was in there in '77.
212 meters.

131
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,118
The human cannonball record!

132
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,287
We never saw the certificate.

133
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,873
It got stolen, I told you.

134
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,710
Are you trying to get me mad?

135
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,890
Now you're one of the family

136
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:25,686
get me a small pot of fresh cream
from the fridge.

137
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,660
Lower, son.

138
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,589
Seen a ghost?

139
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:58,928
She's got a short fuse
but she'll bend over backwards for us.

140
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,429
A contortionist?

141
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,974
No, I'm the veggie drawer!

142
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,809
She was born that way.

143
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:08,771
When her dad beat her,
she'd hide in the cooler.

144
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:13,025
And he spent so long in clink
without shoelaces

145
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,611
he can't even tie them anymore.

146
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:22,034
Mashed potatoes are ready!

147
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,083
Can I help you?

148
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:19,337
Yes, I'd like to see
Mr De Fenouillet, please.

149
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,422
Do you have an appointment?

150
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:25,760
I have something in mind
that concerns him.

151
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:29,597
If it's a project or an idea,
you should write first.

152
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:34,185
I could send him my CAT scan
but I'd rather see him in person.

153
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:37,438
- You're leaving right now.
- Yes. Watch out!

154
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:38,481
Watch out!

155
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:55,039
Throw the clown out.

156
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,833
A bullet in his head?

157
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,461
Something to remember us by!

158
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:30,199
Guys, I need a hand here!

159
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:52,513
We are now world leaders
in the field of fragmentation bombs.

160
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:56,392
Our position in Gulf nations
is four times greater

161
00:23:56,893 --> 00:24:00,688
and we've lowered collateral damage
between 7 and 9%.

162
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:04,733
As you know, we're not monsters.

163
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,278
We don't want anyone dead.

164
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:12,992
We know a wounded soldier
costs the enemy more than a dead one.

165
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:18,038
Our CBS 87
scatters 202 projectiles

166
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:21,250
and clears the equivalent
of four soccer fields.

167
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:24,795
We were present in the Gulf,
in Kosovo

168
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,131
in Afghanistan.

169
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:32,595
It's now time to call to the podium
the mastermind behind this success,

170
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:36,932
our Chief Executive Officer,
François Marconi!

171
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,601
Bravo!

172
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,145
Thank you!

173
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,354
Thank you all!

174
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:52,948
Our tracer bullets,
explosive and armour-piercing bullets

175
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:58,162
are the sharpest,
most destructive and most effective!

176
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:05,461
Rimbaud was a poet
who became an arms dealer.

177
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:08,297
I'll do the exact opposite.

178
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:11,008
However, until it's time to retire

179
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:15,012
I'll continue to associate
ambition and ammunition

180
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:17,473
so our sales go out with a bang!

181
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,893
Long live VDA!

182
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,664
Goodbye, Mr President.

183
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,832
General, I'll see you soon.

184
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,085
Joseph, good night!

185
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,711
Let me remind you

186
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,629
of this season's new rule.

187
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:34,633
An anti-personnel mine
is hidden somewhere in the ground.

188
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,303
An extra element of suspense

189
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,389
courtesy of the French Soccer League.

190
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,643
Suspense was short-lived tonight

191
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:49,773
as the away team's striker,
Sylvestre, has just found it.

192
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:03,245
- A fine speech, sir.
- Thank you, Georges.

193
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:08,042
Rimbaud, an arms dealer...
Is that a historical fact?

194
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:12,212
Absolutely. He still died of gangrene,
with an amputated leg.

195
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,091
Baudelaire had syphilis?

196
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:19,762
Verlaine had the DTs,
Lorca was shot,

197
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,139
Nerval hung himself from a lamp-post.

198
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:26,060
I'd never encourage my kid
to become a poet.

199
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,406
Urbain, wake me at 10 tomorrow.

200
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:42,660
Very good, sir.

201
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:47,498
How long have you been working
for us?

202
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,000
30 years next month.

203
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:56,965
How about redecorating
to mark the 30 years?

204
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,593
We'll put in some hi-tech gear.

205
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:04,556
You know,
a leopard can't change its spots.

206
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,520
Well, change your sweater.

207
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,939
Once every 30 years at least.

208
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,277
He sleeps at the foot of the bed.

209
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:24,154
40 years of griping...

210
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:27,032
Birds of a feather...
Right, Granny?

211
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,034
You old fart!

212
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,689
Did your day go well?

213
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:01,400
- Yes, Daddy.
- I was brilliant.

214
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:05,487
I made a good speech.
I compared myself to Rimbaud.

215
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:06,905
Know who he is?

216
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,740
You need to work out.

217
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,871
Not Rambo, sweetheart. Rimbaud.

218
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:20,085
- Teeth, then bed.
- Very good, sir.

219
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,846
A good day in Paris.

220
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:33,515
Up 0.7 in London...

221
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:49,925
Just a second.
How did you get this number?

222
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,551
Yes, I see.

223
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,430
We can't do this deal by phone.

224
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,683
No, not at all.

225
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,935
A public place.

226
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,937
I don't know...

227
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,773
Wednesday at 3
at the sports department.

228
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,525
Sure.

229
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,831
Belgian waffles!

230
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:26,670
Don't eat too many.
I put rum in the batter.

231
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,441
Hurry, kids, or they'll all be gone!

232
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:50,235
Mr Buster?

233
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:53,572
Is this you
in the Guinness Book of Records?

234
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,490
Holy Moses!

235
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,785
The '77 edition!

236
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:06,126
What did I tell you?

237
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:10,964
"On July 14, 1977,
Théodore Henri from Montreuil..."

238
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:13,258
Who's Théodore Henri? Who?

239
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:18,889
"...shatters Maurice Ronchon's
human cannonball record by 9 meters."

240
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,057
Well?

241
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:24,186
Shatters it by 9 meters!

242
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,400
Well?

243
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:34,780
I'm keeping it.

244
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,199
- No...
- Yes, I'm keeping it.

245
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,076
No...

246
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:42,412
- I'm keeping it!
- Sign my T-shirt then.

247
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:49,711
T. Henri...
Thierry Henri!

248
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:52,297
Buster, I have a job for you.

249
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,216
I won't worm it out of him

250
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:57,219
but, as sure as guns,
something's in the air.

251
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:00,555
Got something up your sleeve?

252
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:03,642
He's going all mysterious on us.

253
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:07,187
We don't care,
we're not that curious.

254
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,332
What time?

255
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:31,336
Tomorrow at 10,
by Sacha Guitry's grave.

256
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,195
Mr Marconi?

257
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:00,282
I'm Omar Boulounga's envoy.

258
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:03,076
Omar Boulounga?
The former dictator of...

259
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:07,581
The former and future dictator.
A revolution is in the works.

260
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,125
I don't do politics.

261
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:14,254
We need assault rifles,
grenades and land mines.

262
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:17,841
What about the Arms Commission
and the Ottawa Treaty?

263
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:20,093
You have everything in stock.

264
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:23,138
Plus an export channel
via Zambia.

265
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,599
We're interested.

266
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:28,018
So what's in it for me?

267
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,311
Do the math

268
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:33,773
and we'll double it in cash,
then diamonds if we succeed.

269
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:35,817
Go on.

270
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,111
He'll nationalise
the diamond mines

271
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:39,863
once he is in office.

272
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,074
Think of something, fast!

273
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,659
Zebras, that's it!

274
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:47,787
Are they white with black stripes
or vice versa?

275
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:50,498
And pygmies...
Are there any pygmy midgets?

276
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,167
How tall are they?

277
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,336
Why is it CIA and not CAI?

278
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,755
Or FBI and not FIB?

279
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:59,299
Think it over but hurry.

280
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:01,760
We fly back to Conakry
on Monday.

281
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,663
You!

282
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:32,040
Yes, you!

283
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,459
I don't know what you're up to

284
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:38,255
but either you leave
and make it alone

285
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:41,341
or you stay and ask us to help.

286
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,551
Is that clear?

287
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,553
Would anyone like to help me?

288
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,806
To do what?

289
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:52,227
I know who made my bullet
and who killed my dad.

290
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:56,731
I'd like to get them both,
but I can't do it alone.

291
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:04,572
"United we stand!"

292
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:14,040
That tall guy is the lookout.

293
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,835
The fellow with the hat
is the dealer.

294
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,963
The smack's hidden
in the janitor's mailbox.

295
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:23,800
That way, if they get grabbed,
they're innocent as lambs.

296
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:25,552
Let's go.

297
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:40,358
Ever punched a sucker
and done a sucker-punch?

298
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,319
You're an old-timer!

299
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:48,616
What is it?

300
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:51,911
Asbestos and lead inspection.
May we come in?

301
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,414
There's no asbestos here!

302
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:58,543
Asbestos can be
right under your noses.

303
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:02,380
We've toiled since the crack of dawn.

304
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,299
So don't kick up a stink.

305
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:11,264
The widow-maker still haunts me.

306
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:15,143
Wherever I go,
she casts her shadow over me.

307
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,311
Hats off to you!

308
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:40,835
My receipt!

309
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:43,630
The more you drink,
the straighter you stand!

310
00:40:02,191 --> 00:40:04,943
The charter flight check-in, please.

311
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:10,115
Brother!

312
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,951
Want a magic necklace
for protection?

313
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:16,621
Peccary beak powder
against the evil spirits in the sky.

314
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,042
You're the boss.
The Commander!

315
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,211
Commander, get something.

316
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:35,890
Youza-youza incense
to conjure up the dead...

317
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:38,435
Leave the passengers alone!

318
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,687
I've told you 100 times!

319
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,856
You've been warned! Get lost!

320
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:46,067
Sorry, gentlemen.
Have a pleasant flight.

321
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,527
At your service.

322
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,921
Excuse us...

323
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:10,091
- Hello.
- We want the flight to America.

324
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:11,926
The departure hall?

325
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:14,387
Yes, we're on our way
to Manhattan

326
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:15,680
to see my son.

327
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,807
You have to check in first.

328
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:20,852
This young lady here
is the half-sister

329
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:24,063
of my son who left for New York
in 1989.

330
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:30,153
1988.

331
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,488
December 12, 1988.

332
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:34,282
There's so much to do
before you leave.

333
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:36,493
You run here and there...

334
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:17,158
Tino Rossi's vertebra.

335
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:21,287
Winston Churchill. Nail clippings.

336
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:26,209
A molar from Marilyn...

337
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,337
Monroe.

338
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:34,092
The foot of Salmanasar I.

339
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,010
The heart of Louis XVI.

340
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:38,221
Matisse's finger.

341
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:42,141
Mussolini's eye...

342
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,228
Not a chance!

343
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:51,985
Once the Arms Commission starts work,
we call the Saudis.

344
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:56,906
Yes, he's a pretty intelligent guy.

345
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:01,202
We won't give them
the source codes.

346
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:03,121
Does it work?

347
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,748
Remember the market in Sarajevo.

348
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:26,352
Collateral damage is always a bonus
when it comes to the media.

349
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,780
Of course...

350
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,579
That's what I keep saying.

351
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,373
You and I

352
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,501
work for the defence industry,

353
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,754
not for the attack industry.

354
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,842
Certainly, my dear fellow,
you're always welcome.

355
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,219
My best to your wife.

356
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:44,138
5PM AT THE TRAIN BLEU.
MUSSOLINI'S EYE IS HERE.

357
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:55,900
We're 10 minutes late. Step on it.

358
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:02,281
- What's wrong, Maurice?
- Etienne, sir.

359
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:07,495
I think we have a flat.
I'm sorry, I'll just check.

360
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,708
Peasant...

361
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:37,066
Hello. I have a booking
in the name of De Fenouillet.

362
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:39,652
Yes, you're expected.

363
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,744
I'm Mr De Fenouillet's right-hand man.

364
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:51,873
He's no longer interested
in Mussolini's eye.

365
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:56,961
But if you can get Achilles' heel
or Adam's apple, he's your man.

366
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:03,801
One, two, three... Testing...

367
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:08,347
I'm Omar Boulounga's envoy.

368
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:26,532
Make me an offer.

369
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:30,119
Let's not put the cart
before the horse

370
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:32,914
if we're barking up the wrong tree.

371
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:37,919
If you have Mussolini's eye,
I'll pay Sotheby's price

372
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,963
for Marilyn's molar.
It's a fair deal.

373
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:44,091
Matisse's finger
and Churchill's nail clippings

374
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:47,178
cost less than half that.
What do you say, Mr Lazare?

375
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,390
Something came up
and Mr Lazare left.

376
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:55,561
Mr Lazare has left you
in the lurch

377
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:57,647
to keep his home fires burning.

378
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:59,232
Who are you?

379
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:04,237
I'm Omar Boulounga's envoy.

380
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:07,031
Boulounga?

381
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:08,199
I thought...

382
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:11,077
He'd gone legit? No way!

383
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:13,746
A revolution...

384
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:19,585
A revolution will soon render unto Omar
that which is Omar's.

385
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:22,421
- I don't do politics.
- You should.

386
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:24,215
As your bread and butter.

387
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:32,014
Twice that in cash,
then in diamonds

388
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:37,603
if the usurper takes to his heels
and Boulounga takes the reins again.

389
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,108
When, how and where?

390
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:45,361
Tuesday 27,
one of your men goes alone

391
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:49,615
to the Gare de I'Est
at 2:45pm with the samples.

392
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:52,910
He'll buy a ticket
for Crécy-la-Chapelle.

393
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,705
He'll get a 30% down payment
in cash.

394
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:58,291
In the coin of the realm.

395
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:04,171
- Well?
- She's patching me through.

396
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:07,383
Marconi?
Omar Boulounga here.

397
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:09,427
Have you thought it over?

398
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:13,014
Bravo. There are no flies on you!

399
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,600
We might not
set the world on fire

400
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:19,145
but it's hard to pull the wool
over our eyes.

401
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:21,814
Anyway,
send a man with the samples

402
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:25,192
to the Gare de I'Est
at 2:45pm tomorrow.

403
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:29,030
Tell him to buy a ticket
for La Ferté Millon.

404
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,699
He'll get a down payment
for our order.

405
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:34,243
Is that clear?
OK, bye!

406
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,208
Ready, boys?

407
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:44,503
What do you mean, "boys"?

408
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:49,926
Things are gonna heat up.

409
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,179
So no girls?

410
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:57,808
Theoretically.

411
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:01,896
But you're not a real...

412
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:05,024
A real what?

413
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:08,402
A real girl, is that it?

414
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:11,238
- I didn't mean that.
- Yes, you did!

415
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:14,241
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did!

416
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:19,872
You meant somewhere
between a bad girl and a tomboy.

417
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:21,624
That's what you meant!

418
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:25,878
But when I squeeze into a suitcase,
I'm welcome to the club!

419
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:55,741
Ladies and gentlemen, arms dealers
are at work in this station.

420
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:58,369
Careful.

421
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:03,082
Do not buy land mines
from unauthorised vendors.

422
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:06,669
You could be committing an offence.

423
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:09,797
Thank you for listening.

424
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,747
What's this?

425
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:46,375
1.72 kilos of steel,
350 grams of polycarbonate,

426
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:48,627
70 grams of Kevlar.

427
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:54,175
Isn't this a little Uzi?

428
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,635
No, it's a MAC 10, or even 11.

429
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:03,392
Step on it
and it'll ruin your foot!

430
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:06,103
Or your life.

431
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,867
We won't recycle that!
It's not for us, guys!

432
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:23,037
It's not scrap,
it fell off a tank!

433
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:24,747
Confiscated!

434
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:26,707
Fool around and it'll end in tears!

435
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:29,835
Or we play Scarface
and head for Chicago.

436
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:32,296
Stage 2, Remington?

437
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:35,841
Strike while the iron's hot.
Line up beneath the banner!

438
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:42,181
De Fenouillet, Boulounga here.
Your man never turned up.

439
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:44,558
- The deal's off.
- The deal's null! Void!

440
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:46,727
VDA made a better offer.

441
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:51,565
Kiss the diamonds goodbye
and the caviar on your toast too.

442
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,219
Marconi for Omar Boulounga.

443
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:22,847
Make it a bit more serious.

444
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:25,432
Marconi?
Boulounga is mad as hell!

445
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,811
Your mercenary skedaddled
with the samples!

446
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:33,107
The deal is rescinded.
ADA are much better clients.

447
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,900
Take that as said!

448
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,834
Mama Chow, I need to go out
for an hour or two.

449
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,003
They're hooked!

450
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:41,050
I'm just showing them the bait for now,
making the spoon sparkle.

451
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:45,262
But once they bite,
I'll need all hands

452
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:46,889
to haul in the big catch.

453
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:49,683
So what do we do now?

454
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:51,810
Twiddle our thumbs?

455
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:54,647
We have to focus our gaze.

456
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:00,986
No, not gays...
Our gaze.

457
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:04,907
I mean, come on...

458
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:08,035
I need volunteers for the rooftops.

459
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:12,164
Thanks, Calculator.
I can count on those who count.

460
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:26,387
- Going somewhere?
- Where you're going.

461
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:29,890
Sorry, I have a sensitive matter
to take care of.

462
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:32,309
I'd rather go alone.

463
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,354
OK, I get it.

464
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:41,151
Because when it comes to delicacy
and even subtlety...

465
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,948
...this gentleman's an expert.

466
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:06,051
The Porn Diva... You'll love this.

467
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:08,345
It barely covers your toy box.

468
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:12,766
It's a bit big...
But you can use it as a nightshirt.

469
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:13,892
I sleep in the nude.

470
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:18,188
Henri is spelled with a Y.

471
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,274
Not an I.

472
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:27,323
You sure? Thierry Henri...

473
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:30,951
Thierry Henri got his name wrong?

474
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:32,953
Don't worry about it, kid.

475
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:35,414
I'm always ready to dip my wick.

476
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:38,584
That's all set then.

477
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:41,587
- Bye.
- See you tonight.

478
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,012
Well?

479
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:52,890
You were fishing for sharks

480
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:55,017
not alley cats or horndogs.

481
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:58,437
We're not married.

482
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,900
No, we're not married.

483
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:05,903
I'm not into perverts like you.

484
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:09,656
And I'm not into contortionists.

485
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:13,410
Mum always told me
to avoid twisted girls.

486
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:16,413
I'm not twisted!

487
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:22,878
I'm a sensitive soul
in a flexible body.

488
00:56:23,004 --> 00:56:25,047
It's different.

489
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:36,642
- Listen up!
- No, you listen, bozo!

490
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:40,187
I spit on your petty scams.

491
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:43,107
Put Boulounga's diamonds
where the sun doesn't shine!

492
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:47,611
You want to play dumb?
What about the Assyrian royal relics?

493
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:52,491
The pillaging of the Baghdad museum?
I have the evidence here!

494
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:55,494
If you want war, think twice!

495
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,206
After a fast-track divorce

496
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:02,084
you don't hook up

497
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:04,670
with the Prime Minister's wife.

498
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:09,383
I have a file on you too!

499
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,787
How about that?

500
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:24,124
Our grandparents did it in the dark,
in pyjamas.

501
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:27,961
If you're going to do it
in front of everyone

502
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:31,632
it could be a bit more..."spectackler",

503
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:35,719
a bit more creative,
a bit more flexible. Right?

504
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:40,849
Bazil!

505
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:56,865
Let's go.

506
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:11,004
Tell me...

507
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:14,758
I'm not too girly
to play fiddler on the roof?

508
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:18,804
The thing is, we needed somebody...

509
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:19,972
Speak up!

510
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:25,477
We needed somebody like you,
both feline and feminine.

511
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:18,859
- Marignan?
- 1515.

512
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:20,861
- Nagasaki?
- 17 kilotons.

513
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:22,529
Kiss!

514
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:36,585
Something unusual happened
during the night, sir.

515
01:02:40,673 --> 01:02:42,507
Goddammit!

516
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:51,391
- Let's go, Maurice.
- Etienne, sir.

517
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:13,580
Delivery for Mr De Fenouillet.

518
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:16,708
You're out of luck.
He just left.

519
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:20,337
- Leave it with me.
- It's a bit heavy.

520
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,592
Come on in.

521
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:13,598
7 meters 50.
Four sections.

522
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:48,091
That elastic gal

523
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:51,094
You can go wild with her, pal

524
01:04:52,805 --> 01:04:55,432
Sweeter than a femme fatale

525
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:58,852
She's quite a sight,
twisting left and right

526
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:03,356
That elastic gal

527
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:27,297
Peckerhead!

528
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:29,174
Hands washed?

529
01:05:31,385 --> 01:05:32,636
Let me see.

530
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,346
You've got a nerve!

531
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:36,640
Move it!

532
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:39,184
No laughing at the table!

533
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:43,563
How's it going with the warmongers?

534
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:47,609
They're hooked. We can reel them in.
Get the net ready.

535
01:05:48,402 --> 01:05:53,114
All the mothers who lose kids
because of those mines...

536
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:57,494
Know Mama Chow's story?

537
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:00,163
She had two girls.

538
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:04,042
One night, at the fairground,
she saw them enter the mirror maze.

539
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:06,086
They never came back out.

540
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:09,798
She searched the streets
for years

541
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:12,050
and ended up homeless.

542
01:06:12,176 --> 01:06:16,137
Afterwards, because of all that,
she adopted us.

543
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:20,058
Enough of your whispering!

544
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:22,268
What do you think of my stew?

545
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:25,063
Lipids 62%, protein 4%, carbs 7%...

546
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:26,690
Give her a break.

547
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:32,237
To make a stew like this,
you have to be a black belt cordon bleu!

548
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:34,114
Oh, come on...

549
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,449
Don't exaggerate.

550
01:06:36,575 --> 01:06:39,411
Got a recipe for your big fish?

551
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:42,080
Fish balls, after we put them
through the mincer!

552
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:45,750
Through the mincer!

553
01:07:22,413 --> 01:07:24,122
No regrets, Buster?

554
01:07:24,248 --> 01:07:26,291
No, he has no regrets.

555
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:35,717
Let's launch Buster into the dumpster!

556
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,146
Calculator?

557
01:07:48,272 --> 01:07:51,357
Distance: 138 meters.
Wind speed: 12 km per hour.

558
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:52,776
South-southwest.

559
01:07:53,819 --> 01:07:56,196
- Weight of projectile?
- 76 kilos.

560
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:59,199
- Sure! Add 4.
- That's Mama Chow's fault.

561
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:00,909
OK, call it 80.

562
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:02,619
What did you eat?

563
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:06,289
Toast: 70 grams. Butter: 37 grams.
Jam...

564
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:08,958
That's enough! Get ready!

565
01:08:17,968 --> 01:08:19,761
Remington...

566
01:08:20,554 --> 01:08:22,305
For the certification...

567
01:08:23,557 --> 01:08:24,641
Action!

568
01:08:30,856 --> 01:08:32,398
We should get started.

569
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:34,400
No, it's too soon. Too soon!

570
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:35,568
59...

571
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:38,988
58...

572
01:08:40,157 --> 01:08:41,616
57...

573
01:08:41,742 --> 01:08:42,826
56...

574
01:08:44,411 --> 01:08:46,246
55 seconds...

575
01:08:57,049 --> 01:08:58,633
What happened?

576
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:00,426
Come on...

577
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:04,389
It's salvaged gear.
It can't be perfect.

578
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:18,778
Slammer!

579
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:21,739
You old bastard!

580
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:24,242
It's salvaged gear!

581
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:19,714
Fire!

582
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:53,099
Look out!

583
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:21,627
No more battery?

584
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:23,963
- It's salvaged gear.
- Salvaged?

585
01:12:24,089 --> 01:12:27,592
I broke the altitude record!
It can't be certified!

586
01:12:27,718 --> 01:12:29,844
- Hold your horses.
- What?

587
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:32,680
Don't haul me over the coals!

588
01:12:32,806 --> 01:12:36,934
It's not the end of the world!
No more battery!

589
01:12:41,106 --> 01:12:45,068
Never touch the goods,
that was the rule. We'll nuke him.

590
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:48,363
- That's her.
- Code 5. No holds barred.

591
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:55,787
Mrs Cissé, hygiene technician?

592
01:12:56,622 --> 01:12:58,414
Your husband has a problem.

593
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:01,000
What's wrong?

594
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:05,254
Your husband's ashamed.
He lost your residence permits.

595
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:07,799
We can get them replaced.

596
01:13:07,925 --> 01:13:11,344
I already tried.
I called Edouard Mangin,

597
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:13,721
my friend and chief of police.

598
01:13:13,847 --> 01:13:15,723
But your file has vanished.

599
01:13:15,849 --> 01:13:18,518
But I swear...

600
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:20,186
Why are you doing this?

601
01:13:21,021 --> 01:13:22,522
Who are you?

602
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:26,734
A shareholder in the company
where your husband works.

603
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:31,322
Since our business has ties
to National Defence...

604
01:13:31,448 --> 01:13:36,035
Then again
we're thinking of your children.

605
01:13:36,161 --> 01:13:40,331
I could always try to persuade
my friend Mangin.

606
01:13:40,457 --> 01:13:42,750
I'm seeing him tomorrow night.

607
01:13:42,876 --> 01:13:45,044
What do you think?

608
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:48,840
Show it to her.

609
01:13:50,008 --> 01:13:54,637
ADA has the exact same machine.
Do you know where it is?

610
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:59,642
It should be installed opposite
an outward-facing plastic curtain,

611
01:13:59,768 --> 01:14:01,102
like that one.

612
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:06,065
We do that so the blast
is directed outwards if ever...

613
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:11,237
The operator works from behind
that armour-plated door.

614
01:14:11,363 --> 01:14:13,531
Lunchtime would be ideal

615
01:14:13,657 --> 01:14:17,118
when the machine's on hold.
Is that possible?

616
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:19,328
- What do I do?
- Hardly anything.

617
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:23,916
Just unscrew this plastic tube
and drop the steel ball in the hole.

618
01:14:24,042 --> 01:14:26,252
Then screw the tube back on.

619
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:31,966
- It could be dangerous.
- Just like going back to Somalia.

620
01:14:32,092 --> 01:14:33,926
Where did I put it?

621
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:39,432
Don't dust under there,
you're overdoing it!

622
01:15:12,257 --> 01:15:14,634
Can you come here a minute?

623
01:15:17,638 --> 01:15:20,723
I can't park there
with a load like that.

624
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:23,059
This won't take long.

625
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:25,269
DANGER: EXPLOSIVES

626
01:16:16,488 --> 01:16:18,155
Holy mackerel!

627
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:46,142
It's odd.
Usually he lets me know.

628
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:50,021
In his dad's day,
you wouldn't have gotten in.

629
01:16:51,398 --> 01:16:52,732
- Nothing to sign?
- No.

630
01:16:52,858 --> 01:16:54,358
Thank you.

631
01:17:05,537 --> 01:17:09,081
What does stuff to blackmail someone
look like?

632
01:17:09,207 --> 01:17:14,629
It can be a video, a recording,
an envelope, photos...

633
01:17:14,755 --> 01:17:16,881
It can be anything, anywhere.

634
01:17:17,424 --> 01:17:19,008
Thanks a lot.

635
01:17:19,134 --> 01:17:21,010
You're welcome.

636
01:17:23,096 --> 01:17:24,639
Zilch...

637
01:17:33,398 --> 01:17:35,107
Where's the box?

638
01:17:35,233 --> 01:17:37,652
I don't get it. He left it here.

639
01:17:37,778 --> 01:17:39,570
The nanny put it away.

640
01:17:39,696 --> 01:17:42,114
No nanny today.
Your son's with his mother.

641
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:43,282
His mother?

642
01:17:43,408 --> 01:17:46,285
That's right. Check every floor
and get that box back.

643
01:17:46,411 --> 01:17:49,789
- I swear it was here.
- I understand!

644
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:53,668
That sweater...

645
01:18:01,301 --> 01:18:06,305
...at ADA this afternoon,
causing a huge amount of damage.

646
01:18:06,431 --> 01:18:08,391
There were no fatalities.

647
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:11,894
The origin of the blast
is being investigated.

648
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:15,731
The company's CEO,
Nicolas Thibault De Fenouillet

649
01:18:15,857 --> 01:18:19,026
has been involved
in several cases of misuse of funds

650
01:18:19,152 --> 01:18:22,113
but acquitted each time.

651
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:26,325
I defy anyone to provide
a shred of tangible evidence!

652
01:18:26,451 --> 01:18:28,744
It's a scandal! A scandal!

653
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:30,746
More news on LCI...

654
01:18:49,891 --> 01:18:52,810
Calm down! Deep breaths...

655
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:59,191
Mind exercise.
Vital questions...

656
01:18:59,317 --> 01:19:01,068
Number 12.

657
01:19:01,194 --> 01:19:03,654
Who invents funny stories?

658
01:19:04,322 --> 01:19:07,908
Number 27. Why is your destination
always in the map's fold?

659
01:19:08,034 --> 01:19:11,704
Number 62. How many feet
does it take to wear down a step?

660
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:19,044
The company's CEO,
Nicolas Thibault De Fenouillet

661
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:22,506
has been involved
in several cases of misuse of funds

662
01:19:22,632 --> 01:19:24,967
but acquitted each time.

663
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:41,734
You wanted war...

664
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:44,069
Here comes a blitz!

665
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:47,406
- Now, sir?
- Go ahead.

666
01:19:47,532 --> 01:19:50,201
- Go!
- Go!

667
01:20:51,221 --> 01:20:52,263
Well?

668
01:20:53,765 --> 01:20:56,267
You thought we'd rot in jail?

669
01:20:57,185 --> 01:21:00,062
You got how much
to bring us down?

670
01:21:11,241 --> 01:21:13,492
Exercise number 8: Money.

671
01:21:13,618 --> 01:21:16,078
Bread, beans, dough, gravy, loot,

672
01:21:16,204 --> 01:21:19,290
moolah, cash, gelt,
mazuma, lucre, berries!

673
01:23:01,601 --> 01:23:06,105
You know,
I came here to teach you a lesson

674
01:23:06,231 --> 01:23:11,110
but these clowns have given me
another idea.

675
01:23:15,073 --> 01:23:16,615
What?

676
01:23:19,619 --> 01:23:21,537
You'd never dare risk it.

677
01:23:22,247 --> 01:23:23,789
Risk what?

678
01:23:25,625 --> 01:23:30,921
We both refused to sell arms
to rebels plotting a coup.

679
01:23:31,047 --> 01:23:35,634
They blew up ADA to get revenge,
then came after you.

680
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:39,304
We rushed to your rescue.

681
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:43,142
- Right, Libarski?
- Only we got here too late.

682
01:23:44,561 --> 01:23:46,228
Bummer.

683
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:47,771
Wait!

684
01:24:07,625 --> 01:24:10,294
I'll give you the tape, all the proof.

685
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:13,338
The looting of the Baghdad museum.

686
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:16,050
Take it and go.
Leave me alone.

687
01:24:18,803 --> 01:24:20,429
That won't be enough.

688
01:24:21,514 --> 01:24:23,724
Cut the crap!

689
01:24:25,852 --> 01:24:28,979
OK, I shouldn't have sabotaged
your plant.

690
01:24:29,105 --> 01:24:30,773
Forget the stolen shells.

691
01:24:32,108 --> 01:24:33,150
What shells?

692
01:24:35,612 --> 01:24:37,488
The truck of shells.

693
01:24:38,615 --> 01:24:40,741
He had a truck of shells stolen!

694
01:24:40,867 --> 01:24:42,910
- Was that us?
- No, it wasn't.

695
01:24:43,536 --> 01:24:44,912
See, it wasn't us.

696
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:47,706
The shells weren't me.

697
01:24:47,832 --> 01:24:50,501
I'd say it was probably them.

698
01:24:51,461 --> 01:24:54,338
Yes, it had to be them.

699
01:24:54,464 --> 01:24:55,881
It's him.

700
01:24:56,007 --> 01:24:57,216
It's him!

701
01:24:58,134 --> 01:25:00,385
He was spotted
on security tapes

702
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:02,221
pretending to be a waiter!

703
01:25:02,347 --> 01:25:04,640
I thought he was with you!

704
01:25:06,434 --> 01:25:10,437
I think we both got screwed.
What a goddamn mess!

705
01:25:10,563 --> 01:25:12,189
Who do you work for?

706
01:25:12,315 --> 01:25:15,484
Let's just say I'm freelance.

707
01:25:16,778 --> 01:25:20,739
I have a love-nest on the Left Bank.
Let's grill him there.

708
01:25:20,865 --> 01:25:22,950
My limo's outside.

709
01:25:23,076 --> 01:25:24,868
About time!

710
01:25:24,994 --> 01:25:27,955
You're running late, guys.
They aren't the problem now.

711
01:25:28,665 --> 01:25:29,706
He is!

712
01:25:33,878 --> 01:25:36,421
Aeschylus died when a tortoise

713
01:25:36,548 --> 01:25:38,298
hit him on the head.

714
01:25:38,424 --> 01:25:41,552
Lully got gangrene,
beating time to music.

715
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:47,683
Barbarossa drowned in a river
after forgetting to remove his armour.

716
01:25:47,809 --> 01:25:52,688
And I'm going to die of fright
like the fool that I am.

717
01:26:34,772 --> 01:26:36,190
Slammer!

718
01:26:36,316 --> 01:26:37,649
Plan B!

719
01:26:37,775 --> 01:26:42,070
Emergency!

720
01:28:00,483 --> 01:28:03,860
Pont de Crimée! Terminus!

721
01:28:18,876 --> 01:28:20,377
Hop on!

722
01:28:28,261 --> 01:28:30,429
240... 230...

723
01:28:30,555 --> 01:28:32,514
220... 210...

724
01:28:45,236 --> 01:28:47,154
90... 70...

725
01:28:50,074 --> 01:28:51,158
Go!

726
01:28:51,284 --> 01:28:52,909
Dump the trash!

727
01:29:18,102 --> 01:29:19,644
Oh, bugger!

728
01:29:19,771 --> 01:29:21,730
Refuse pick-up!

729
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:58,683
You're getting our goat!

730
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:01,770
Your goose is cooked.
Your number's up.

731
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:05,273
Here comes the sun!

732
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,943
Time for a North African break!

733
01:30:16,035 --> 01:30:18,954
Great landing, Slammer.
Thanks a lot.

734
01:30:19,789 --> 01:30:21,998
- It's...
- Salvaged gear!

735
01:30:38,599 --> 01:30:40,183
Again...

736
01:30:42,478 --> 01:30:44,020
Again!

737
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:33,278
Seen this before?

738
01:31:49,921 --> 01:31:51,379
How about you?

739
01:31:51,506 --> 01:31:53,673
Does this ring a bell?

740
01:32:10,942 --> 01:32:15,487
Don't move.

741
01:32:30,628 --> 01:32:32,504
You want a ransom?

742
01:32:35,424 --> 01:32:38,093
Name your price. We can pay!

743
01:32:40,137 --> 01:32:43,598
The French President is a friend!

744
01:32:43,724 --> 01:32:47,686
Get rid of this grenade.
It's ludicrous!

745
01:32:47,812 --> 01:32:51,439
We can call him.
You'll see, he'll pay.

746
01:32:51,566 --> 01:32:53,149
Speak clearly, moron!

747
01:32:58,406 --> 01:32:59,781
What do you want?

748
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:04,202
Forgive us...

749
01:33:04,328 --> 01:33:07,289
Forgive us for your children.

750
01:33:10,376 --> 01:33:12,210
That's right. Forgive us.

751
01:33:12,336 --> 01:33:16,339
For all the women raped in dirty wars.

752
01:33:16,465 --> 01:33:20,218
I only sell arms to people
who fight clean wars!

753
01:33:20,344 --> 01:33:24,097
Sure! You're still selling
land mines on the sly!

754
01:33:29,061 --> 01:33:31,980
- I'm all for terrorism!
- Me too.

755
01:33:32,106 --> 01:33:34,608
The 300 dead
in the Ankara Boeing!

756
01:33:34,734 --> 01:33:37,319
The explosive was mine!

757
01:33:37,445 --> 01:33:40,572
When you were in short pants,
I was supplying arms

758
01:33:40,698 --> 01:33:42,532
to the ETA and the IRA!

759
01:33:42,658 --> 01:33:46,703
How about Darfur?
Where do they get their arms?

760
01:33:46,829 --> 01:33:49,164
What? You stole that deal?

761
01:33:49,290 --> 01:33:51,207
Peasant!

762
01:36:51,055 --> 01:36:53,348
You want a ransom?

763
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:57,060
Name your price. We can pay!

764
01:36:57,186 --> 01:36:59,979
When you were in short pants,
I was supplying arms

765
01:37:00,105 --> 01:37:01,523
to the ETA and the IRA!

766
01:37:01,649 --> 01:37:03,483
What do you want?

767
01:37:08,405 --> 01:37:09,531
SEND TO ALL CONTACTS

768
01:37:12,451 --> 01:37:16,079
I only sell arms to people
who fight clean wars!

769
01:37:19,875 --> 01:37:24,879
Everyone go to YouTube
and type "arms dealers fooled."

770
01:37:33,055 --> 01:37:37,308
The 300 dead in the Ankara Boeing!
The explosive was mine!

771
01:37:37,434 --> 01:37:40,103
The French President is a friend!

772
01:37:40,229 --> 01:37:43,773
Forgive us
for all the women raped in dirty wars.

773
01:37:43,899 --> 01:37:46,693
I only sell arms to people
who fight clean wars!

774
01:37:46,819 --> 01:37:48,903
Take a look at this!

775
01:37:49,822 --> 01:37:54,534
When you were in short pants,
I was supplying the ETA and the IRA!

776
01:37:54,660 --> 01:37:57,537
How about Darfur?
Where do they get their arms?

777
01:37:57,663 --> 01:37:59,831
Mr Marconi!

778
01:38:00,666 --> 01:38:02,500
The share price has crashed...

779
01:38:02,626 --> 01:38:05,211
You're facing a 15-year sentence...

780
01:38:05,337 --> 01:38:06,880
You've lost custody...

781
01:38:07,006 --> 01:38:09,215
How close are you
to the Prime Minister's wife?

782
01:38:11,427 --> 01:38:15,346
De Fenouillet,
abandoned by his political friends

783
01:38:15,472 --> 01:38:17,891
even by the French President,

784
01:38:18,017 --> 01:38:20,518
has fled to an unknown destination.

785
01:38:20,644 --> 01:38:25,023
ADA will close down any day now.

786
01:38:39,788 --> 01:38:42,206
"The warmongers out of the picture

787
01:38:42,333 --> 01:38:46,461
"Bazil, proud as a peacock,
beat his breast and made amends

788
01:38:46,587 --> 01:38:51,174
"while the Gal stopped nitpicking
and got off her high horse.

789
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:53,676
"No need to be a rocket scientist

790
01:38:53,802 --> 01:38:57,347
"to see they were making sheep's eyes

791
01:38:57,473 --> 01:39:02,268
"and it was clear as crystal
that they were now as thick as thieves."
