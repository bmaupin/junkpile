1
00:00:38,792 --> 00:00:42,458
A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT

2
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,374
Saturday the 6th of January, 1917,

3
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:19,666
five condemned soldiers
were escorted to Bouchavesnes

4
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:21,749
at the Front in the Somme.

5
00:02:29,584 --> 00:02:30,916
Watch out for the wire!

6
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,208
The first,
once cheerful and adventurous,

7
00:02:56,375 --> 00:03:01,291
wore the tag number 2124.
He was drafted from the Seine area.

8
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:05,416
On his feet were boots,
taken from a dead German.

9
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:09,374
Before becoming 2124,
he was known as Bastoche

10
00:03:09,542 --> 00:03:11,708
and was hooked on a pretty redhead,

11
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,333
a certain Véronique Passavant.

12
00:03:17,542 --> 00:03:19,541
He was a carpenter.

13
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:32,374
Taking a break from his woodwork,
they'd go for a beer

14
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:35,374
at Little Louis' bar,
in Golden Hand St.

15
00:03:38,042 --> 00:03:41,541
He'd taken his boots from an enemy
who no longer needed them.

16
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:45,874
Stuffed with straw or newspaper,

17
00:03:46,084 --> 00:03:48,499
they replaced his old clodhoppers.

18
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:04,083
He was court-martialed
for self-mutilation.

19
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:08,791
Gunpowder had been found
on his wounded hand.

20
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,166
He faced the death sentence.

21
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,124
Watch out for the wire!

22
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:34,124
The second soldier
was tag number 4077,

23
00:04:34,292 --> 00:04:36,208
also from near the Seine.

24
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:41,416
He was a welder
for the State Railways, in Bagneux.

25
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:43,874
His name was Francis Gaignard,

26
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:46,041
nicknamed Six-Sous.

27
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:50,499
He knew the poor build the canons
of their own destruction,

28
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:52,999
but it's the rich who sell them.

29
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:55,791
He tried
to explain it to the troops,

30
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,999
but he wasn't a good speaker.

31
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:01,499
And cheap wine,
poverty's best friend,

32
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:03,958
deadened the soldiers' eyes,

33
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,916
making it difficult
to get through to them.

34
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,499
Number 1 81 8 was surely the bravest
and the toughest of them all.

35
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:59,541
He had once
killed a fellow officer...

36
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:04,416
an officer who kicked the dead.

37
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,541
Get up!

38
00:06:06,709 --> 00:06:07,916
You swines!

39
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:09,833
You lazy cowards!

40
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,291
You! Get up!

41
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:16,749
Attack! Attack!

42
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,458
You! Get going!

43
00:06:32,084 --> 00:06:33,416
No one ever found out.

44
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,999
Benoît Notre Dame was a farmer
from Dordogne.

45
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,749
One August morning,

46
00:07:06,042 --> 00:07:08,333
they came to get him at his farm

47
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,458
and sent him off on a train.

48
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,166
Watch out for the wire!

49
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:31,374
The telephone wire is the only link
to the land of the living.

50
00:07:31,542 --> 00:07:35,458
A flimsy wire, their only chance
for President Poincaré's pardon.

51
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:38,041
Even if the only one
to still believe in it

52
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:42,999
is him.
Number 7328, recruited in Corsica.

53
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:45,124
Angel Bassignano.

54
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:49,166
According to all who'd known him,

55
00:07:49,334 --> 00:07:51,874
he was no angel at all.

56
00:07:52,042 --> 00:07:55,958
He was a liar, a cheat, a show-off,

57
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,208
a sneak and a troublemaker.

58
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,583
Before all this,

59
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:15,958
Tina Lombardi worked as his whore.

60
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:20,499
He'd received a 5-year sentence for
an affair of either love or honour,

61
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,749
depending on who he was talking to.

62
00:08:22,917 --> 00:08:26,708
It was, in fact, a conflict
between village pimps.

63
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,166
Summer 1916,
common-law criminals were enlisted

64
00:08:37,334 --> 00:08:40,791
to beef up regiments
melted in the fires at Verdun.

65
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,208
They gave him the choice.

66
00:08:42,417 --> 00:08:44,499
It's been shitting shells
round here!

67
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:46,166
No, it's been rather quiet.

68
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,083
Who are those for?

69
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:52,583
Well, actually...
you'll be attacking tomorrow.

70
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:58,374
We're getting a head start.

71
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,791
Watch out for the wire!

72
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:32,958
The fifth was a "Cornflower",
the nickname for the class of '17.

73
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:35,541
He was five months shy of 20.

74
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:40,749
These days, everything scared him.

75
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,791
French canons short-firing,

76
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,499
the wind that heralded
the mustard gas attacks,

77
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,833
executions to set an example.

78
00:09:49,417 --> 00:09:51,583
He hadn't been like that before,

79
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,083
quite the opposite,

80
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,333
braving storms as he helped
lighthouse keepers.

81
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:30,916
And then came one shell too many.

82
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:37,999
There you go... The winning ticket
back to your fiancée.

83
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:39,874
The ticket for a court-martial.

84
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:43,458
Turn a blind eye, Sarge.
He's been through enough.

85
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:44,916
They could execute him.

86
00:11:45,084 --> 00:11:46,874
- Be human for once.
- Shut up!

87
00:11:47,042 --> 00:11:48,291
Please, Sarge!

88
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:49,291
Shut up!

89
00:11:55,917 --> 00:11:58,874
The first time
Mathilde and Manech made love,

90
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:02,208
he fell asleep,
his hand on her breast.

91
00:12:25,334 --> 00:12:27,291
Each time his wound throbs,

92
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:30,458
Manech feels Mathilde's heart
in his palm.

93
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,124
Each beat brings her closer to him.

94
00:12:37,334 --> 00:12:40,791
If Manech were dead,
Mathilde would know.

95
00:12:42,334 --> 00:12:44,166
Since the death notice,

96
00:12:44,334 --> 00:12:48,541
she stubbornly holds on to her
intuition, like to a flimsy wire.

97
00:12:49,084 --> 00:12:51,374
She never gets discouraged.

98
00:12:53,792 --> 00:12:56,208
And Mathilde
is of a cheerful disposition.

99
00:12:56,542 --> 00:13:01,249
If that wire doesn't lead her
to her lover, never mind...

100
00:13:01,584 --> 00:13:03,916
she can always use it as a noose.

101
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:14,208
In June 1920, Mathilde received
a letter from a nun.

102
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:17,749
A patient at the Rennes hospital
wants to see her.

103
00:13:18,834 --> 00:13:23,416
He'd met Manech in January '17
at the Front in the Somme.

104
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,374
August 1912.

105
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:33,833
Handsome, wasn't I?

106
00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:35,624
It's a De Dion,

107
00:13:36,584 --> 00:13:38,041
with direct drive.

108
00:13:39,167 --> 00:13:41,166
Please, tell me about Manech.

109
00:13:42,084 --> 00:13:43,624
In January '17,

110
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:47,374
I escorted five condemned soldiers.

111
00:13:51,292 --> 00:13:52,999
He was one of them...

112
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,166
Yes.

113
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,749
I was to take them
to a front-line trench.

114
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,833
Gendarmes were waiting
with the prisoners

115
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:10,374
near a bombed-out cemetery.

116
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,999
What are you doing
with those German boots?

117
00:14:22,167 --> 00:14:23,124
Waiting.

118
00:14:23,417 --> 00:14:24,458
What for?

119
00:14:24,792 --> 00:14:26,958
Poincaré's pardon? You'll wait!

120
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,791
He'll sign it!

121
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,499
I shouldn't
even have been condemned.

122
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:35,416
I'm Corsican, not French!

123
00:14:44,542 --> 00:14:45,666
Leave him be.

124
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:48,249
He's lost it,
but that's for the best.

125
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,374
Finished, Lieutenant?

126
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:02,874
The cold has saved that one.

127
00:15:03,084 --> 00:15:05,583
Gangrene would've got him
in summer.

128
00:15:09,417 --> 00:15:10,749
And Manech?

129
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:13,958
Was he in pain?

130
00:15:14,917 --> 00:15:17,166
They had to cut off two fingers,

131
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:19,208
but he wasn't suffering anymore.

132
00:15:21,334 --> 00:15:22,958
I led them to a trench,

133
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,249
called "Bingo Crépuscule".

134
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:43,916
Bloody hell!

135
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,541
Couldn't you have lost them
on your way?

136
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:49,208
A kick in the ass
to get rid of them!

137
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:52,458
My orders
are to bring you these five.

138
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,208
And I'll tell you my orders!

139
00:15:54,584 --> 00:15:57,541
I'm to throw these guys over the top

140
00:15:57,834 --> 00:15:59,833
and leave them to die like dogs

141
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,041
between our line and the Jerries'!

142
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:04,708
Those are my damned orders,
Sergeant!

143
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:10,333
You see, Sergeant, with the Jerries,
there's a kind of status quo.

144
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,041
It's a little too calm?
Let's start the fireworks

145
00:16:13,209 --> 00:16:15,041
and watch all hell let loose!

146
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:20,291
Soup, guys!
You're lucky, it's still warm.

147
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,416
Beetroot and fennel.

148
00:16:30,334 --> 00:16:32,458
What can I get for you?

149
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:37,041
A large hot chocolate
and some bread with honey.

150
00:16:37,292 --> 00:16:39,999
I'd kill my parents to get you that!

151
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:42,541
Do you mind, Lieutenant?

152
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:45,541
He's an orphan!

153
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:49,666
He'll get it. Célestin Poux
is the "Mess Hall Marauder",

154
00:16:50,084 --> 00:16:51,958
the "Kitchen Raider".

155
00:16:53,334 --> 00:16:56,666
Fifteen minutes later,
he came back with it all.

156
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,666
Salted Guérande butter,

157
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:00,416
lavender honey,

158
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,791
and...

159
00:17:02,417 --> 00:17:04,416
cocoa from Nigeria!

160
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:09,666
Grand...

161
00:17:10,334 --> 00:17:11,749
Tell me, Cornflower,

162
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:15,291
you've no one to write to?
A fiancée?

163
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:17,791
Mathilde.

164
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,416
Her name is Mathilde.

165
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:28,499
I hear her heart beating,
like Morse code.

166
00:17:31,542 --> 00:17:32,708
We're engaged.

167
00:17:36,334 --> 00:17:40,083
Luckily, we won't have to wait
till the end of the war.

168
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:45,249
Now I can go straight home
after the execution.

169
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,708
Should I spare you the rest?

170
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:02,499
I'm lame, not dim.

171
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:04,749
What happened?

172
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:08,874
We opened the barbed wire

173
00:18:09,709 --> 00:18:12,583
and equipped the five
against the cold.

174
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:21,166
Célestin Poux gave up a red woolen
glove to protect your fiancé's hand.

175
00:18:24,167 --> 00:18:25,166
Are they far?

176
00:18:25,334 --> 00:18:28,541
Too far for grenades,
too near for artillery.

177
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:32,333
Gas is out of the question.
The gasser always gets it!

178
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,708
Think they'll make it?

179
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:37,499
If they're not blown to bits,
they'll starve and freeze.

180
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,458
Either way, it'll amuse the Jerries.

181
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:49,583
A Corporal gave Bastoche,
the carpenter, a hug.

182
00:18:50,209 --> 00:18:51,791
It was Corporal Gordes.

183
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:54,541
They clearly knew each other
before the war.

184
00:18:55,292 --> 00:18:56,249
And then,

185
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:58,583
over they went.

186
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,541
- Shit...
- Shut up.

187
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:15,333
- Shit!
- Shut up!

188
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:20,833
September '14.

189
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:22,791
1 50 pound weight, easy!

190
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,958
And I wasn't at my best!

191
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,791
But that morning,

192
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,249
in January '17,
was Manech still alive?

193
00:19:31,834 --> 00:19:35,499
At dawn,
Favart called out their names.

194
00:19:37,459 --> 00:19:40,749
Apart from the Dordogne farmer,
they all replied.

195
00:19:40,917 --> 00:19:42,166
Bassignano!

196
00:19:42,334 --> 00:19:43,333
Sir!

197
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,499
Bouquet!

198
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:46,083
What now?

199
00:19:46,709 --> 00:19:48,041
Langonnet!

200
00:19:48,709 --> 00:19:50,249
Yeah, still here!

201
00:19:50,459 --> 00:19:53,291
The Cornflower,
hide yourself better.

202
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:55,249
Notre Dame!

203
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,249
That's all I know.

204
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,333
I wrote up my report
with a heavy heart.

205
00:20:12,417 --> 00:20:15,499
About time, Esperanza! The Brits
are replacing us, we're off.

206
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:17,666
So, Bingo-thingy?

207
00:20:18,334 --> 00:20:19,291
What's that?

208
00:20:19,459 --> 00:20:22,874
The condemned prisoners' list,
signed by Capt. Favourier.

209
00:20:23,042 --> 00:20:24,458
Give it to me.

210
00:20:35,584 --> 00:20:38,291
Don't just stand there like that.
This isn't Pompeii!

211
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,583
You've been promoted.
You're off to the Vosges.

212
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,291
Even so, Sir,

213
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:46,458
this expedition is going to be
hard to swallow.

214
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:47,624
Lucky you.

215
00:20:47,792 --> 00:20:50,749
Where you're going, there's
mustard gas and throat lozenges.

216
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,499
The famous Vosges sweets.

217
00:20:52,667 --> 00:20:53,583
Dismissed!

218
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:57,124
A few months later,
I was wounded, in the Somme.

219
00:20:57,834 --> 00:21:01,041
I ended up in the same ambulance
as Chardolot,

220
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,916
a corporal from Bingo Crépuscule.

221
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,458
But he only had
a few days left to live.

222
00:21:12,459 --> 00:21:14,083
It's me. Esperanza.

223
00:21:14,792 --> 00:21:16,249
Bingo Crépuscule, remember?

224
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:19,666
Sorry, I don't recognize you.

225
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:23,083
The five thrown over
into no-man's-land,

226
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,291
what happened to them?

227
00:21:25,709 --> 00:21:26,791
What do you think?

228
00:21:28,209 --> 00:21:29,499
No one made it.

229
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,916
Your conscience bothering you,
Esperanza?

230
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,458
You should've stuck around.

231
00:21:37,334 --> 00:21:39,208
You'd have seen capital Ms,

232
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:42,708
underwear being waved
and a flying albatross.

233
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:46,416
You're delirious with fever!

234
00:21:47,209 --> 00:21:52,124
We sent over five men
and recovered five stiffs.

235
00:21:52,459 --> 00:21:53,541
Conclusion...

236
00:21:57,292 --> 00:22:01,416
My eyes are gone but I can imagine
your expression and I like it.

237
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:06,499
He really spoke of capital Ms
and an albatross?

238
00:22:08,292 --> 00:22:09,708
And underwear.

239
00:22:11,459 --> 00:22:12,916
Here you go, Miss.

240
00:22:13,084 --> 00:22:13,874
In here

241
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:18,416
are the prisoners' belongings
I was to return to their families.

242
00:22:19,459 --> 00:22:21,624
My health's prevented it.

243
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,124
That's the letter
the Dordogne farmer, Notre Dame,

244
00:22:26,292 --> 00:22:27,041
wrote to his wife.

245
00:22:27,417 --> 00:22:30,166
I sent the original
just after Bingo.

246
00:22:31,292 --> 00:22:33,624
You're here
because of the mustard gas?

247
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:37,166
Not even. Damned Spanish flu!

248
00:22:38,209 --> 00:22:42,041
Death moves in mysterious ways.

249
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:50,208
If you can't cry, try talking.

250
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:54,999
If you can't talk, say nothing.

251
00:22:56,667 --> 00:23:00,583
But sometimes,
talking can bring on the tears.

252
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,916
Tears say what you can't say,

253
00:23:03,084 --> 00:23:04,833
if you get my drift?

254
00:23:08,042 --> 00:23:10,791
Otherwise,
you can just keep that sour-face!

255
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:45,124
Little Louis,
tell Véro I'm thinking of her.

256
00:23:45,292 --> 00:23:47,333
Shame she won't talk to me.

257
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,749
Saw Biscuit, we patched things up.

258
00:23:49,917 --> 00:23:51,791
Adieu, my friend. Bastoche.

259
00:23:56,542 --> 00:24:00,874
"Benoît Notre Dame, number 1 81 8.
I won't be writing for a long time."

260
00:24:01,042 --> 00:24:04,041
Tell old Bernay
I want to settle up by March.

261
00:24:04,292 --> 00:24:07,583
His manure's too costly,
watch out for him.

262
00:24:08,042 --> 00:24:10,166
Tell my Baptistin that I so love

263
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,374
that he'll be fine
if he listens to his dear mother.

264
00:24:13,584 --> 00:24:17,166
She's the kindest person I know.
Love you. Benoît.

265
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:22,999
"For Tina Lombardi,
from Angel Bassignano."

266
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,833
If Chickpea comes in before
dinner's called, Manech is alive.

267
00:25:18,167 --> 00:25:18,999
I'm not hungry.

268
00:25:23,917 --> 00:25:25,541
Dinner's ready.

269
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:28,916
Mathilde, dinner!

270
00:25:29,417 --> 00:25:30,624
Coming!

271
00:25:32,125 --> 00:25:34,791
Mathilde was born
the 1st of January, 1900.

272
00:25:35,042 --> 00:25:37,499
It's easy for calculating her age.

273
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:41,874
In 1903, her parents died
in the n° 44 bus accident.

274
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:42,791
Since then,

275
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:44,791
Mathilde often says to herself,

276
00:25:44,959 --> 00:25:47,791
"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust!
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust..."

277
00:25:54,209 --> 00:25:55,541
Her uncle and aunt,

278
00:25:55,709 --> 00:25:58,999
Sylvain and Bénédicte,
have raised her,

279
00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:04,374
with her parents' life insurance
invested by Pierre-Marie Rouvière.

280
00:26:05,292 --> 00:26:08,833
When she was five,
Mathilde came down with polio.

281
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,124
She was bedridden for months,

282
00:26:11,292 --> 00:26:13,666
despite mustard compresses...

283
00:26:14,417 --> 00:26:15,624
pendulums

284
00:26:15,834 --> 00:26:17,666
and four-leaf clover infusions.

285
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:23,291
Today, Mathilde is twenty.

286
00:26:23,459 --> 00:26:24,958
She plays the tuba.

287
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:29,083
It is the only instrument capable
of imitating a distress call.

288
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:34,041
Chickpea, the dog,
farts in his sleep.

289
00:26:34,542 --> 00:26:37,833
When she hears it,
Bénédicte never fails to say,

290
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,833
Doggie fart, gladdens my heart.

291
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,583
Mathilde needs daily treatment.

292
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:46,749
Since the Armistice, Georges Cornu,
a swimming champion,

293
00:26:46,917 --> 00:26:48,124
massages her.

294
00:26:48,334 --> 00:26:52,666
She used to get embarrassed,
but she got over it.

295
00:26:52,834 --> 00:26:56,458
Mathilde sometimes imagines
that Georges admires her,

296
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:58,083
tormented with desire.

297
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,291
What's more, he once said,

298
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:02,749
You do have a fine figure, Miss.

299
00:27:02,917 --> 00:27:05,499
And I've kneaded quite a few.

300
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:10,999
After that,
how should she call him?

301
00:27:11,167 --> 00:27:12,291
Dear Georges...

302
00:27:14,042 --> 00:27:15,333
My dear Georges...

303
00:27:17,792 --> 00:27:18,958
Jojo...

304
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,083
Sometimes,
before falling asleep,

305
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:25,541
she imagines herself
in arousing situations.

306
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,541
Mathilde doesn't need
to fantasize for very long

307
00:27:33,709 --> 00:27:35,916
before reaching fulfilment.

308
00:27:37,709 --> 00:27:39,208
Since his disappearance,

309
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:43,374
she can't bear to think about her
fiancé as she satisfies herself.

310
00:27:43,584 --> 00:27:44,916
That's the way it is...

311
00:27:52,334 --> 00:27:54,833
If I were you, Mathilde,
I'd forget him.

312
00:27:55,459 --> 00:27:57,249
Why chase pipe dreams?

313
00:27:57,417 --> 00:28:00,833
If he was alive,
you'd have heard from him.

314
00:28:01,209 --> 00:28:02,749
He was taken prisoner.

315
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:07,666
And stayed with a German girl
with braids and big boobs!

316
00:28:07,834 --> 00:28:10,541
A Breton boy eating sauerkraut!

317
00:28:10,709 --> 00:28:11,499
Impossible!

318
00:28:13,459 --> 00:28:16,583
- Can I help?
- Keep your feet on the ground.

319
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,499
I stand on my own two feet!

320
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:19,999
- What?
- Never mind.

321
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:21,624
I heard you anyway.

322
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,249
But your dreams don't stand up.

323
00:28:26,167 --> 00:28:27,958
Manech
can't have been taken at Bingo.

324
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:31,041
Our men took the trench facing it.

325
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:33,833
Normally, it's the winners

326
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,374
who take prisoners.

327
00:28:35,542 --> 00:28:37,124
So he's lost his mind.

328
00:28:37,292 --> 00:28:40,458
Or he's in hiding,
to avoid hard labour.

329
00:28:40,709 --> 00:28:43,041
Stop dreaming, Mathilde!

330
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,916
Face up to it.

331
00:28:45,084 --> 00:28:47,749
You'll find a husband, despite...

332
00:28:52,709 --> 00:28:54,458
Something's off-key.

333
00:28:55,292 --> 00:28:59,333
I'll find the "Mess Hall Marauder",
Célestin Poux.

334
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,124
What can I get for you?

335
00:29:01,292 --> 00:29:05,041
Or the Corsican's whore.
She might know more than me.

336
00:29:05,542 --> 00:29:06,708
Tomorrow, I go to Paris.

337
00:29:08,417 --> 00:29:09,166
What for?

338
00:29:09,334 --> 00:29:11,666
To find a survivor
from Bingo Crépuscule.

339
00:29:19,167 --> 00:29:23,249
Germain Pire, Private Detective
The Peerless Pry

340
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:29,624
I'm used to handling
red-hot affairs.

341
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:31,124
I've a cupboard full.

342
00:29:31,292 --> 00:29:34,458
Scandals that would've been
brushed under the carpet...

343
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:37,374
brought to light by Pire's prying.

344
00:29:38,959 --> 00:29:40,833
Take this big affair...

345
00:29:41,209 --> 00:29:42,916
very delicate.

346
00:29:43,209 --> 00:29:48,166
In '17, a train derails.
425 soldiers on leave, dead.

347
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:52,416
The enquiry reveals how
an officer ordered the departure,

348
00:29:52,584 --> 00:29:55,083
despite faulty brakes.

349
00:29:55,334 --> 00:29:58,541
A total cover-up
by Poincaré's government.

350
00:29:59,375 --> 00:30:03,041
The victims' families only hope
of finding the officer?

351
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:05,249
Germain Pire!

352
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,708
The Peerless Pry.

353
00:30:07,875 --> 00:30:10,999
Peerless, Miss.
I found their officer,

354
00:30:11,292 --> 00:30:13,749
to the military's great displeasure.

355
00:30:14,042 --> 00:30:16,749
Granted, he was dead and buried.

356
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,833
I'll just pack my bags and be on
my way to track down Poux Célestin

357
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,499
and the Corsican's fiancée.

358
00:30:23,875 --> 00:30:25,791
And your fees, Mr. Peerless Pry?

359
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,374
The Pry only bleeds dry
sitting ducks, Miss.

360
00:30:32,084 --> 00:30:34,374
For you, I can do...

361
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:36,791
20 francs a day.

362
00:30:37,292 --> 00:30:39,208
Plus expenses, of course.

363
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:40,999
Why so kind?

364
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:45,499
Hélène, come and say hello.

365
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:49,374
Don't worry about expenses.
Germain Pire eats little,

366
00:30:49,542 --> 00:30:52,708
doesn't drink and tips sparingly.

367
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,083
Notre Dame de Paris?

368
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,249
Not Notre Dame de Paris!

369
00:31:04,417 --> 00:31:07,208
I'm calling from Paris
about Notre Dame Benoît!

370
00:31:07,667 --> 00:31:09,083
Benoît Notre Dame!

371
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:10,916
A strapping,
good-hearted farmer.

372
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:12,958
Died for his country.

373
00:31:13,292 --> 00:31:15,374
I've lost many a parishioner.

374
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:18,541
Are his wife and Baptistin
still there?

375
00:31:18,917 --> 00:31:21,749
Quiet!
Miss Minet, I can't hear a thing!

376
00:31:22,292 --> 00:31:26,083
No. She upped and left one day,
with no forwarding address.

377
00:31:27,042 --> 00:31:28,416
Is that a choir I hear?

378
00:31:28,584 --> 00:31:32,374
Of course, it's a choir!
We are in a church, Miss!

379
00:31:32,542 --> 00:31:34,708
But that's no hymn at your end!

380
00:31:36,834 --> 00:31:38,999
Thank you, Father. Goodbye.

381
00:31:41,209 --> 00:31:42,666
Bingo Crépuscule!

382
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:45,208
I can't make head nor tail of it!

383
00:31:46,042 --> 00:31:48,458
I thought you liked defending
lost causes.

384
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:52,958
Your impertinence
was charming at 10, not at 20!

385
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:54,583
Then start taking me seriously.

386
00:31:55,084 --> 00:31:58,791
You're wasting your money
on a grotesque crusade!

387
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:02,249
Bingo Crépuscule!
Why not Yippee doodle-doo?

388
00:32:03,417 --> 00:32:05,374
I want access to army archives.

389
00:32:09,084 --> 00:32:11,416
Let's say
there's an ounce of truth in this.

390
00:32:11,584 --> 00:32:14,291
If one man has survived,
he risks hard labour!

391
00:32:14,459 --> 00:32:15,791
And you know it!

392
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:18,833
Your prying would put him
in great danger!

393
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,499
Be reasonable.

394
00:32:22,292 --> 00:32:24,124
Your parents entrusted me...

395
00:32:24,292 --> 00:32:25,499
"Ashes to ashes..."

396
00:32:26,042 --> 00:32:27,374
That's just it.

397
00:32:28,334 --> 00:32:30,791
They entrusted you
with my happiness.

398
00:32:34,042 --> 00:32:35,208
Goodbye.

399
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:39,541
Thank you, Pierre-Marie.

400
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:45,791
Don't be like that,
my dear Mathilde.

401
00:32:46,542 --> 00:32:48,583
I'm thinking of your future.

402
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:53,499
Sorry to see your health's worsened,
despite the massages.

403
00:32:55,584 --> 00:32:57,458
I'll see what I can do.

404
00:33:13,084 --> 00:33:15,208
It doesn't only happen in Lourdes!

405
00:33:42,042 --> 00:33:45,958
I'm looking for Tina Lombardi.
I knew her when she was little...

406
00:33:50,709 --> 00:33:53,833
Ladies, I'm Tina Lombardi's uncle

407
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,291
and I'd like to know...

408
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:04,916
Excuse me...

409
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:08,499
I look after
the Lombardi family's interests

410
00:34:08,667 --> 00:34:10,208
and I'm looking for Tina.

411
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:13,499
She's come into some money.

412
00:34:24,292 --> 00:34:26,749
You're the one
looking for Tina Lombardi?

413
00:34:27,334 --> 00:34:28,541
Well, actually...

414
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:37,208
Ever been to Corsica?

415
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:40,791
Very pretty, very picturesque.

416
00:34:41,209 --> 00:34:43,166
But Tina's walking the street

417
00:34:43,334 --> 00:34:44,374
somewhere else.

418
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:47,624
Luckily,
a highly-placed member of the Police

419
00:34:47,792 --> 00:34:49,999
picked up her trail in Bar-Le-Duc.

420
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:53,791
Valentina Emilia Maria Lombardi,
aka Tina,

421
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:56,416
was registered in 1916

422
00:34:56,584 --> 00:35:00,374
near the 23rd regiment's camp
of Marseilles.

423
00:35:01,792 --> 00:35:05,124
Since the Armistice,
the chick has flown the coop!

424
00:35:05,375 --> 00:35:07,124
I've lost her trail,
but I've been busy.

425
00:35:21,334 --> 00:35:23,791
She's disappeared into thin air.

426
00:35:24,709 --> 00:35:26,041
So, you're giving up.

427
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:27,249
Not at all.

428
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:30,416
Pire never admits defeat.
Pire is stubborn.

429
00:35:30,584 --> 00:35:32,874
Pire's peer doesn't exist.

430
00:35:33,917 --> 00:35:35,916
Perfect! Thank you.

431
00:36:00,917 --> 00:36:02,749
Just a little bit.

432
00:36:16,334 --> 00:36:17,791
Not my eyes.

433
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:45,749
Careful with that!

434
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:44,958
What can I get you?

435
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:49,374
This is my fiancé.

436
00:37:51,584 --> 00:37:52,333
And him,

437
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,791
the carpenter...

438
00:37:53,959 --> 00:37:55,499
I think you know him.

439
00:38:02,542 --> 00:38:03,916
My throat's dry.

440
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:07,458
- "Good glass of wine..."
- "Keeps the doctor in line."

441
00:38:08,292 --> 00:38:09,999
My great-aunt's motto.

442
00:38:10,167 --> 00:38:12,874
Died in 1911 in Besançon,
she was 99.

443
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:14,833
Never sick a day...

444
00:38:20,042 --> 00:38:21,124
Good luck.

445
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:22,791
Touch wood.

446
00:38:24,584 --> 00:38:25,749
The war?

447
00:38:29,209 --> 00:38:31,666
A hyena in the Botanical Gardens.

448
00:38:31,834 --> 00:38:33,958
I was showing off, stroking it.

449
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:36,458
Bastoche and Biscuit made this.

450
00:38:37,334 --> 00:38:38,374
Biscuit?

451
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:41,208
His best friend. They met in 1910

452
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:44,458
during the floods,
saving a lady's life.

453
00:38:45,209 --> 00:38:46,666
Bastoche was talented

454
00:38:46,834 --> 00:38:49,458
but Biscuit... a genius.

455
00:38:49,709 --> 00:38:51,916
A magician with a chisel!

456
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,249
He pegged all the articulations.

457
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:02,624
This is for you.

458
00:39:03,042 --> 00:39:05,416
"Louis,
tell Véro I'm thinking of her.

459
00:39:05,584 --> 00:39:07,458
"Shame she won't talk to me.

460
00:39:07,625 --> 00:39:10,208
"Saw Biscuit, we patched things up.

461
00:39:11,334 --> 00:39:13,749
"Adieu, my friend. Bastoche."

462
00:39:16,667 --> 00:39:20,458
To patch things up means
they'd argued. You know why?

463
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:21,874
A mystery.

464
00:39:23,834 --> 00:39:26,124
They went through hell together,

465
00:39:26,584 --> 00:39:29,458
the Marne, the Woëvre, the Somme...

466
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:33,791
Then one day, and who knows why,
they stopped talking.

467
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:37,499
Biscuit was transferred.

468
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:41,708
He died
in a military hospital bombing.

469
00:39:43,875 --> 00:39:46,416
I'm glad they finally
patched things up.

470
00:39:49,542 --> 00:39:53,041
They won't be queuing up outside,
today.

471
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,541
Pour me one?

472
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:56,541
She's thirsty!

473
00:39:59,459 --> 00:40:01,416
A wooden hand, a heart of gold.

474
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,291
To love.

475
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,666
True love!

476
00:40:04,834 --> 00:40:06,333
But who was Véro?

477
00:40:06,917 --> 00:40:10,166
Véronique Passavant.
His regular, his woman.

478
00:40:10,334 --> 00:40:11,916
They often came in together.

479
00:40:12,167 --> 00:40:14,416
Why would they have argued?

480
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:17,666
He may have strayed
and she wouldn't forgive him.

481
00:40:24,959 --> 00:40:27,166
There you go. '17, this way.

482
00:40:28,584 --> 00:40:31,333
What exactly are the red files?

483
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:32,791
Secret defence.

484
00:40:32,959 --> 00:40:35,166
You need a mandate
from someone high up.

485
00:40:35,334 --> 00:40:36,708
Of course, they're upstairs!

486
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:38,124
Go and help him.

487
00:40:41,334 --> 00:40:44,166
Let's say
you were someone high up...

488
00:40:44,334 --> 00:40:47,083
then you could give us the mandate.

489
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:50,458
If I thought like that,
I wouldn't be an officer.

490
00:40:50,625 --> 00:40:54,333
Consider yourself lucky
you've been allowed in.

491
00:40:54,834 --> 00:40:56,874
It usually takes months.

492
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,666
It looks tidy
but it's really a mess.

493
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,958
So, the Somme...

494
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:06,374
The Bouchavesnes sector,
trench 1 08.

495
00:41:08,042 --> 00:41:09,124
What a state...

496
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,333
Look at this. Appalling!

497
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:14,249
May I help?

498
00:41:14,417 --> 00:41:17,666
Thank you for replying favourably
to the General...

499
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:19,874
We're very good friends.

500
00:41:20,042 --> 00:41:23,208
Bouchavesnes...
two friends of mine died there.

501
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:26,291
Dreadful,
the battles in that trench...

502
00:41:26,459 --> 00:41:28,416
Paris wasn't much better.

503
00:41:28,667 --> 00:41:31,083
Couldn't even find a taxi
after the opera.

504
00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:32,624
So I heard!

505
00:41:32,792 --> 00:41:35,583
We'd like information on trench 108.

506
00:41:36,084 --> 00:41:39,499
Posting slips, trenches 104, 105.

507
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:42,166
Trench 107. Where's 106?

508
00:41:44,334 --> 00:41:45,291
Trench 108.

509
00:41:46,375 --> 00:41:48,499
How annoying,
it's written on both sides!

510
00:41:50,084 --> 00:41:51,624
Trench 108.

511
00:41:52,834 --> 00:41:56,583
"Dug by the Germans,
taken by us in 1916 and renamed

512
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,999
"Bingo Crépuscule."
Why not Yippee doodle-doo?

513
00:42:00,334 --> 00:42:02,083
"January 6th, nothing to report.

514
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:04,249
"The 7th, heavy combat with losses.

515
00:42:04,417 --> 00:42:07,624
"Killed in action:
Capt. Favourier, history teacher.

516
00:42:07,792 --> 00:42:10,499
"Lt Benoît Estrangin,

517
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,708
"Corporal..."

518
00:42:14,917 --> 00:42:16,166
Strange.

519
00:42:16,334 --> 00:42:18,708
Certain losses
are filed confidential.

520
00:42:18,875 --> 00:42:21,374
Confidential? You mean...

521
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,208
Sorry.

522
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:25,291
Can't you...

523
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:27,624
Sorry, we can't look any further.

524
00:42:29,417 --> 00:42:31,624
Not even the General.

525
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:32,958
Please.

526
00:42:42,834 --> 00:42:45,541
Thank you for the time you've taken.

527
00:42:45,709 --> 00:42:46,833
You're welcome.

528
00:42:49,709 --> 00:42:54,041
Nothing here of interest.
Posting slips, commissary bills.

529
00:42:54,209 --> 00:42:55,458
The routine.

530
00:42:55,625 --> 00:42:57,333
I assumed as much.

531
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,208
It was to be expected.

532
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:04,749
You've gone too far!

533
00:43:12,459 --> 00:43:15,416
I do hope this paper
wasn't filed secret defence!

534
00:43:21,792 --> 00:43:24,124
You must tell me if it's important.

535
00:43:24,292 --> 00:43:25,708
It's nothing.

536
00:43:27,125 --> 00:43:29,124
Just a leave.

537
00:43:29,542 --> 00:43:30,958
From the President?

538
00:43:31,792 --> 00:43:32,958
That's right.

539
00:43:33,167 --> 00:43:34,874
President Poincaré
sometimes granted a leave

540
00:43:35,042 --> 00:43:36,583
to a deserving soldier.

541
00:43:37,417 --> 00:43:38,499
End of story!

542
00:43:38,959 --> 00:43:40,416
I'll see you out.

543
00:44:03,459 --> 00:44:05,291
Corporal Bouquet Kléber...

544
00:44:05,834 --> 00:44:07,749
Corporal Gaignard Francis...

545
00:44:08,459 --> 00:44:10,749
Private Notre Dame Benoît...

546
00:44:10,917 --> 00:44:13,374
Private Bassignano Angel...

547
00:44:13,667 --> 00:44:16,041
Private Langonnet Manech...

548
00:44:16,292 --> 00:44:19,708
For self-mutilation,
you are sentenced to death.

549
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:26,749
If, before the count of 7,
the train hasn't entered the tunnel,

550
00:44:26,917 --> 00:44:29,166
or the ticket inspector hasn't come,

551
00:44:29,334 --> 00:44:30,958
Manech is dead!

552
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:35,499
1, 2, 3,

553
00:44:36,667 --> 00:44:40,999
4, 5, 6...

554
00:44:42,209 --> 00:44:43,333
Ticket, please!

555
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,833
April fool!

556
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:07,499
When the newspaper strike is over,
we can place your ad.

557
00:45:07,667 --> 00:45:11,958
"Reward for information concerning
Bingo Crépuscule."

558
00:45:12,125 --> 00:45:14,999
Encouraging her
won't bring back her appetite.

559
00:45:15,167 --> 00:45:16,833
Take her to the Quimper Fair.

560
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,458
What for?

561
00:45:18,667 --> 00:45:19,999
A change of scenery.

562
00:45:20,709 --> 00:45:22,708
You might meet a nice boy.

563
00:45:22,959 --> 00:45:24,249
What for?

564
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:28,124
To get married and have children.
Tell her!

565
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:29,874
Can you pour me one?

566
00:45:30,042 --> 00:45:31,083
You drink now?

567
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,916
"Glass of wine
keeps the doctor in line."

568
00:45:34,709 --> 00:45:35,791
Where's that from?

569
00:45:35,959 --> 00:45:38,291
Dead-Hand barman
with a wooden hand.

570
00:45:38,459 --> 00:45:41,999
His aunt's motto. Died at a hundred,
in Besançon, 1911.

571
00:45:42,584 --> 00:45:43,458
Repeat that?

572
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:47,166
In Besançon, in 1911,

573
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:50,708
a 99 year-old lady left behind
a wooden-handed nephew,

574
00:45:50,875 --> 00:45:53,874
owner of the Dead-Hand bar,
in Golden Hand St,

575
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:56,666
to whom she often said
what Sylvain just asked me.

576
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:59,291
She's already drunk!

577
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,541
Look!

578
00:46:39,875 --> 00:46:41,583
An albatross is stubborn.

579
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:46,166
He knows he can outlast the wind.

580
00:47:35,042 --> 00:47:36,708
Hey, my gravel!

581
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,458
My gravel!

582
00:47:40,834 --> 00:47:43,749
Véronique Passavant,
17th of July, 1920.

583
00:47:43,917 --> 00:47:47,708
I'm writing from Little Louis' bar.
He told me about you.

584
00:47:47,875 --> 00:47:50,333
I must tell you about an encounter

585
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,916
which left me quite shaken up.

586
00:47:52,209 --> 00:47:55,499
I headed for Bastoche's workshop.
I was feeling down.

587
00:47:56,167 --> 00:47:57,916
I want to talk to Bastoche.

588
00:47:58,792 --> 00:47:59,958
Bastoche?

589
00:48:00,125 --> 00:48:04,166
He died. At the Front in the Somme.
Didn't you know?

590
00:48:04,334 --> 00:48:05,958
I know something else.

591
00:48:06,209 --> 00:48:07,333
What?

592
00:48:08,042 --> 00:48:11,541
From the hospital,
where I care for dying syphilitics,

593
00:48:11,917 --> 00:48:13,833
a patient sends you this.

594
00:48:16,334 --> 00:48:20,041
If you don't want to die, covered
with oozing sores, answer me!

595
00:48:20,875 --> 00:48:23,416
The comrade hiding
with your Bastoche...

596
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:24,916
Tell me...

597
00:48:25,084 --> 00:48:26,958
tell me he's Corsican.

598
00:48:27,792 --> 00:48:31,333
I was already traumatized by nuns
when I was little!

599
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:35,499
Tina Lombardi
knows something we don't.

600
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:37,916
What?

601
00:48:38,084 --> 00:48:39,624
The Lombardi girl...

602
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:42,458
she knows something we don't.

603
00:48:43,542 --> 00:48:47,124
That would prove
Bastoche had escaped.

604
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:49,791
With another condemned prisoner.

605
00:48:50,167 --> 00:48:53,083
That hussy obviously thinks
it's her Angel.

606
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:58,291
But if Bastoche had escaped,
he'd have looked out for Manech.

607
00:48:58,667 --> 00:48:59,874
If he escaped...

608
00:49:00,042 --> 00:49:01,041
Give me that.

609
00:49:01,667 --> 00:49:04,499
With "ifs",
a flea could carry an elephant.

610
00:49:04,667 --> 00:49:05,916
Maybe.

611
00:49:06,084 --> 00:49:08,791
But without "ifs",
might as well hang myself.

612
00:49:16,584 --> 00:49:19,708
Thanks to you, I spend my time
picking gravel out of the lawn!

613
00:49:20,417 --> 00:49:23,583
When I see gravel, I make it a point
of arriving in style.

614
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:24,708
For the Miss.

615
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,041
Leprince Hardware,
Paris, 25th of July, 1920.

616
00:49:28,292 --> 00:49:31,583
Sunday lends itself to writing.
I'm replying regarding

617
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:34,583
Célestin Poux and other survivors
from Bingo Crépuscule.

618
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:38,624
I knew the fellow.
The smartest thief I ever met.

619
00:49:38,792 --> 00:49:41,374
Thanks to him,
I never went without!

620
00:49:45,584 --> 00:49:47,999
Olivier Nergeton,
Animated Toys.

621
00:49:48,875 --> 00:49:51,166
Célestin Poux was our salvation,

622
00:49:51,334 --> 00:49:53,874
aka the Mess Hall Marauder
or Justa Bit More.

623
00:49:54,042 --> 00:49:55,333
He falsified losses,

624
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:58,916
making up numbers
to give double rations.

625
00:49:59,084 --> 00:50:03,166
If you should see him,
tell him we'll never forget him.

626
00:50:05,292 --> 00:50:08,666
Etienne Morillon, teacher,
3rd of August, 1920.

627
00:50:08,834 --> 00:50:10,958
He always had us laughing.

628
00:50:11,459 --> 00:50:14,416
He had even trained
the company's mascot for us!

629
00:50:17,334 --> 00:50:19,208
Good morning. What weather!

630
00:50:19,542 --> 00:50:21,958
Germain Pire, private detective.

631
00:50:22,125 --> 00:50:23,916
Mathilde has spoken of you.

632
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:25,958
Sylvain!

633
00:50:26,584 --> 00:50:28,416
Tell Mathilde to come down.

634
00:50:28,584 --> 00:50:30,874
That Mr. Pry is here to see her.

635
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:33,708
Poux's been hopping around.

636
00:50:35,417 --> 00:50:38,041
Two days in Dreux,
then Troyes, Castre,

637
00:50:38,209 --> 00:50:39,541
five days in Sète.

638
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:47,208
It'll take luck and patience
to land him.

639
00:50:47,917 --> 00:50:48,749
Too bad.

640
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:52,791
Hélène, some savoury biscuits.

641
00:50:53,084 --> 00:50:54,541
Taste them.

642
00:50:54,959 --> 00:50:56,416
Tell me what you think.

643
00:50:57,292 --> 00:50:59,416
The kitchen's more comfortable.

644
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:01,124
Thank you, Bénédicte.

645
00:51:03,584 --> 00:51:04,541
I'll leave you.

646
00:51:07,417 --> 00:51:10,958
Poux can't stay in one place,
whereas Tina Lombardi...

647
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:13,083
she's got us running in circles.

648
00:51:13,375 --> 00:51:15,958
I know.
And she's the queen of disguise.

649
00:51:16,417 --> 00:51:17,916
Anything new on Biscuit?

650
00:51:23,209 --> 00:51:25,083
That's Benjamin Gordes.

651
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:26,333
The day he won

652
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:30,208
the Carpentry Prize
for the sixth consecutive year.

653
00:51:34,542 --> 00:51:35,583
That's right.

654
00:51:38,375 --> 00:51:39,208
Biscuit,

655
00:51:39,375 --> 00:51:41,124
Bastoche's best friend,

656
00:51:41,292 --> 00:51:43,166
is none other than Benjamin Gordes.

657
00:51:45,792 --> 00:51:47,749
A soldier from their company

658
00:51:47,917 --> 00:51:51,666
said they were like brothers
before it went sour.

659
00:51:53,709 --> 00:51:55,999
- Why won't you tell me?
- Stop it!

660
00:51:56,209 --> 00:51:57,208
Tell me!

661
00:51:58,084 --> 00:52:00,208
I don't want to fight you,
so stop it!

662
00:52:00,375 --> 00:52:02,416
Why won't you talk?

663
00:52:02,959 --> 00:52:04,416
Whose idea was it?

664
00:52:05,584 --> 00:52:08,458
Mine?
No, it was your idea!

665
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:09,666
Bastard!

666
00:52:11,917 --> 00:52:13,374
It was his idea!

667
00:52:13,875 --> 00:52:16,041
All because of a woman!

668
00:52:16,709 --> 00:52:20,499
Véronique Passavant
finished with Bastoche in June '16.

669
00:52:20,667 --> 00:52:24,708
And just after, he fought like
a mad dog with Benjamin Gordes.

670
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:26,999
Don't need to be Pythagoras!

671
00:52:27,167 --> 00:52:29,833
They didn't meet again
before Bingo Crépuscule?

672
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,749
Where it all ended!

673
00:52:31,917 --> 00:52:33,791
No, where it all begins, Mr. Pire.

674
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:35,624
Where it all begins...

675
00:52:36,917 --> 00:52:39,958
Tina Lombardi is sure
Bastoche is alive.

676
00:52:40,417 --> 00:52:44,791
What made him different
from the others that evening?

677
00:52:45,875 --> 00:52:48,249
He was the only carpenter?

678
00:52:49,459 --> 00:52:52,291
Something made Bastoche
different from the others.

679
00:52:52,584 --> 00:52:53,916
His German boots!

680
00:52:56,084 --> 00:52:58,208
He was the only one
with German boots!

681
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:00,249
Of course. You're right!

682
00:53:01,042 --> 00:53:04,999
Tina Lombardi's discovered that
a man with German boots survived!

683
00:53:06,125 --> 00:53:08,624
I bet he was seen with a comrade!

684
00:53:08,792 --> 00:53:11,916
I saw two soldiers
who looked like tramps.

685
00:53:12,084 --> 00:53:14,166
One wore boots taken from a Jerry.

686
00:53:14,334 --> 00:53:16,416
He was holding up the other.

687
00:53:18,459 --> 00:53:23,208
We also know Bastoche had patched
things up with his best friend!

688
00:53:23,375 --> 00:53:24,458
Exactly!

689
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:27,958
Did it change the course of events
that night?

690
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:30,916
If I don't break the peel,

691
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:35,166
Gordes managed to save
Bastoche and Manech.

692
00:53:40,125 --> 00:53:43,374
I'm never going to get that pie
in the oven!

693
00:53:43,542 --> 00:53:47,916
I must go back to Paris.

694
00:53:48,709 --> 00:53:52,374
Again?
That money's going up in smoke.

695
00:53:52,542 --> 00:53:53,749
"Ashes to ashes..."

696
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:33,416
Pilot fish!

697
00:54:35,417 --> 00:54:36,916
Excuse me, Elodie Gordes?

698
00:54:37,084 --> 00:54:38,833
Over there, selling carrots.

699
00:54:39,584 --> 00:54:40,833
Thank you.

700
00:54:51,209 --> 00:54:52,499
Never seen him!

701
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,208
Which one don't you know?

702
00:54:57,375 --> 00:54:59,249
Him, by any chance?

703
00:54:59,834 --> 00:55:03,041
Why did Bastoche and Biscuit argue?
Was it over you?

704
00:55:03,209 --> 00:55:04,291
I have nothing to say!

705
00:55:04,459 --> 00:55:06,708
- I want to know!
- Leave me alone!

706
00:55:11,084 --> 00:55:14,124
They last met at Bingo Crépuscule.

707
00:55:14,667 --> 00:55:18,083
My fiancé was also there.
With Bastoche.

708
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,708
In that shithole of a trench!

709
00:55:21,125 --> 00:55:22,666
I want to understand.

710
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:27,083
I want to understand!

711
00:55:32,792 --> 00:55:34,333
It's not what you think.

712
00:55:35,459 --> 00:55:38,624
I can't talk about it.
Give me your address.

713
00:55:39,625 --> 00:55:41,458
My spelling's terrible

714
00:55:42,417 --> 00:55:44,541
but I'll explain it all in a letter.

715
00:55:44,709 --> 00:55:45,666
I promise.

716
00:56:07,459 --> 00:56:09,791
Go ahead! My gravel!

717
00:56:11,625 --> 00:56:13,041
Nothing for me?

718
00:56:13,875 --> 00:56:14,958
What?

719
00:56:15,125 --> 00:56:16,541
Nothing for me?

720
00:56:17,084 --> 00:56:18,624
Just the newspaper.

721
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:22,083
They talk about everything
except Elodie Gordes.

722
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:23,208
Very funny!

723
00:56:23,375 --> 00:56:26,666
You should read it,
one can learn things!

724
00:56:26,834 --> 00:56:31,124
Has the President opened an inquest
on Bingo Crépuscule?

725
00:56:33,375 --> 00:56:35,916
He might have done,

726
00:56:36,334 --> 00:56:39,583
if he hadn't fallen from a train
in his pyjamas.

727
00:56:39,792 --> 00:56:42,083
Well, he wears pyjamas!

728
00:56:42,959 --> 00:56:44,999
He wears pyjamas!

729
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,666
We recovered five stiffs.

730
00:57:02,917 --> 00:57:04,458
Conclusion...

731
00:57:16,084 --> 00:57:19,541
We knew you were a thief.
But a pyromaniac?

732
00:57:33,167 --> 00:57:34,166
All for me?

733
00:57:34,334 --> 00:57:36,166
No. Just this one.

734
00:57:36,334 --> 00:57:40,083
If I'm not picking up gravel,
I'm picking up the postman!

735
00:57:43,542 --> 00:57:45,833
The gravel's gone? A fair fight.

736
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,499
Fighting is never fair.

737
00:57:47,667 --> 00:57:50,166
- Can I offer you a short one?
- Won't say no.

738
00:57:51,542 --> 00:57:55,166
Miss, I beg you to keep my secret
to yourself.

739
00:57:55,459 --> 00:57:58,666
When I met my husband,
he already had four children.

740
00:57:58,834 --> 00:58:00,166
None were his.

741
00:58:00,334 --> 00:58:02,874
Out of kindness,
he'd married a widow with TB.

742
00:58:03,042 --> 00:58:04,708
She was Polish, like me.

743
00:58:04,917 --> 00:58:07,166
He adopted her children
before her death.

744
00:58:07,334 --> 00:58:09,291
I was also an unmarried mother.

745
00:58:10,875 --> 00:58:14,124
He then found himself
the father of five,

746
00:58:14,292 --> 00:58:16,499
though he couldn't have any
of his own.

747
00:58:23,209 --> 00:58:25,041
You're going to run me over!

748
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,749
We had four years of tenderness.

749
00:58:28,375 --> 00:58:29,333
We had plans.

750
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:32,208
We dreamt
of seeing the sea together.

751
00:58:32,417 --> 00:58:34,083
Then the war came.

752
00:58:35,084 --> 00:58:37,833
I thought Bastoche
would take care of him,

753
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,374
their being posted together.

754
00:58:39,584 --> 00:58:42,666
But during his leave,
in September, 1915,

755
00:58:42,834 --> 00:58:44,708
just after the battle of Artois,

756
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,208
I knew
nothing would ever be the same.

757
00:58:57,584 --> 00:58:59,958
Over there,
it's all we have to keep going.

758
00:59:16,542 --> 00:59:19,499
Once, in a burning field,
I saw some comrades...

759
00:59:19,667 --> 00:59:22,583
Their cartridge belts
exploded like fireworks.

760
00:59:26,917 --> 00:59:30,708
Once, we even had to use
the body of a friend

761
00:59:31,625 --> 00:59:33,708
as a shield.

762
00:59:45,667 --> 00:59:48,249
There had been something
on his mind.

763
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:51,208
He came out with it
on the second night.

764
00:59:52,875 --> 00:59:56,291
If I desert, the gendarmes
will come and get me.

765
00:59:58,667 --> 01:00:01,624
My only way out
is to have a sixth child.

766
01:00:04,375 --> 01:00:07,999
If you have six children,
they send you home.

767
01:00:09,375 --> 01:00:12,083
As I said,
he couldn't have children.

768
01:00:12,667 --> 01:00:14,791
I didn't dare think
what was on his mind,

769
01:00:14,959 --> 01:00:17,208
but he just wouldn't let it go.

770
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,041
It's not betrayal if I'm asking you.

771
01:00:25,209 --> 01:00:26,999
Especially if it's with Bastoche.

772
01:00:27,834 --> 01:00:28,916
Don't touch!

773
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:35,124
The five aren't mine,
so why not a sixth?

774
01:00:35,292 --> 01:00:39,041
You'd have nine months to wait.
The war will be over by then.

775
01:00:39,209 --> 01:00:40,916
It will never be over. Never!

776
01:00:41,084 --> 01:00:44,499
They'd be nine months of hope.
Have you no heart?

777
01:00:45,667 --> 01:00:48,666
And then one day, I found a note
from Kléber Bouquet,

778
01:00:48,834 --> 01:00:50,624
known as Bastoche,

779
01:00:50,792 --> 01:00:55,333
saying to tie a coloured cloth at
the window if he wasn't to come up.

780
01:01:09,875 --> 01:01:10,874
Coffee?

781
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:12,666
I'd love some!

782
01:01:13,209 --> 01:01:14,583
- After you.
- Please.

783
01:01:23,375 --> 01:01:24,458
Thank you.

784
01:01:28,209 --> 01:01:29,124
Sugar?

785
01:01:29,292 --> 01:01:30,958
No, thank you.

786
01:01:37,417 --> 01:01:38,708
It's mother of pearl?

787
01:01:39,375 --> 01:01:41,624
Yes, Benjamin made it.

788
01:01:49,042 --> 01:01:52,041
- It's odd...
- How strange we never met.

789
01:01:54,375 --> 01:01:56,333
The children aren't here?

790
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:57,791
Yes, but...

791
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,166
they're playing outside.

792
01:02:05,875 --> 01:02:08,124
- A pick-me-up?
- Please.

793
01:02:08,667 --> 01:02:10,833
No, no... Sorry.

794
01:02:11,375 --> 01:02:13,124
I don't fancy one.

795
01:02:15,792 --> 01:02:17,583
Neither do I.

796
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:21,624
Elodie, we'll say we've done it.

797
01:02:22,834 --> 01:02:24,708
It'll calm him down.

798
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:27,791
It will make things easier
for you, for me...

799
01:02:28,709 --> 01:02:30,083
for everybody.

800
01:03:41,584 --> 01:03:44,624
Funny how your smile
opens the parentheses.

801
01:03:47,417 --> 01:03:49,583
I'll close them
as late as possible...

802
01:03:50,667 --> 01:03:52,916
In two days, at the train station.

803
01:04:13,209 --> 01:04:14,333
Come on...

804
01:04:15,375 --> 01:04:17,124
give me one last smile.

805
01:04:19,375 --> 01:04:21,458
To close the parentheses.

806
01:04:22,834 --> 01:04:24,541
I didn't even get pregnant!

807
01:04:25,042 --> 01:04:28,333
But soon, fear no longer tormented
my husband.

808
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:30,999
It was jealousy.

809
01:04:32,125 --> 01:04:35,166
"Where? When? Often?
Which positions?"

810
01:04:35,334 --> 01:04:39,374
"Did you enjoy it?" It became
a living hell for both of us.

811
01:04:40,459 --> 01:04:43,624
Now, Bastoche is dead,
as you know,

812
01:04:44,209 --> 01:04:47,458
and my husband was killed
in a hospital bombing.

813
01:04:48,209 --> 01:04:52,999
It's a relief to confide in you.
At times, I think I'm going mad.

814
01:04:53,209 --> 01:04:54,708
Elodie Gordes.

815
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:57,208
Matti! Hurry up.

816
01:04:57,375 --> 01:05:00,249
Mr. Rouvière is on the phone.
He's waiting.

817
01:05:00,417 --> 01:05:01,624
Come on!

818
01:05:18,625 --> 01:05:21,083
Mathilde? Pierre-Marie here.

819
01:05:22,542 --> 01:05:25,208
I have some bad news.

820
01:05:25,917 --> 01:05:29,833
Not really bad... News you're
already supposed to know.

821
01:05:30,834 --> 01:05:33,458
But news you can no longer ignore.

822
01:05:34,667 --> 01:05:37,541
You were right about one thing...

823
01:05:37,709 --> 01:05:42,958
Manech and his four comrades
were in that absurdly named trench.

824
01:05:44,084 --> 01:05:46,624
They were buried
in the Herdelin cemetery,

825
01:05:48,084 --> 01:05:53,374
after being temporarily buried
under a tarpaulin in a bomb crater.

826
01:05:54,709 --> 01:05:56,416
That's that, my dear Mathilde.

827
01:06:05,834 --> 01:06:10,083
In June, 1909,
Mathilde is 9 years old.

828
01:06:10,792 --> 01:06:12,874
Manech Langonnet is 10.

829
01:06:13,042 --> 01:06:14,708
Does it hurt when you walk?

830
01:06:16,125 --> 01:06:18,499
It's Friday, or Saturday...

831
01:06:19,459 --> 01:06:21,499
Mathilde can't remember.

832
01:06:25,875 --> 01:06:27,291
Do you have any friends?

833
01:06:28,875 --> 01:06:30,999
I can be your friend.

834
01:06:35,084 --> 01:06:36,791
Do I stink of fish?

835
01:06:37,959 --> 01:06:40,291
Ever been
to the top of the lighthouse?

836
01:06:40,959 --> 01:06:43,791
I can carry you
to the top of the stairs.

837
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:47,749
Because my dad's the keeper!

838
01:06:48,792 --> 01:06:52,458
Be stuck-up then! Church mouse!
Country bumpkin!

839
01:06:52,625 --> 01:06:54,999
Do you want a kick in the pants?

840
01:07:18,625 --> 01:07:20,583
Can you see far from the top?

841
01:07:57,292 --> 01:07:59,958
I'm going to gobble up your ears!

842
01:08:04,584 --> 01:08:06,999
I'll throw you in the dungeon!

843
01:08:11,042 --> 01:08:13,999
I am the squid's servant!

844
01:08:27,834 --> 01:08:29,624
Doggie fart, gladdens my heart!

845
01:10:17,334 --> 01:10:19,708
Manech's Marrying Mathilde!

846
01:10:21,042 --> 01:10:23,916
Mathilde's Marrying Manech!

847
01:10:52,292 --> 01:10:54,916
- I don't smoke.
- I know, but take it...

848
01:10:56,917 --> 01:10:58,916
It'll help you make new friends.

849
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:37,749
If I reach the bend before the car,

850
01:11:37,917 --> 01:11:39,874
Manech will come back alive!

851
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,791
If I reach the bend...

852
01:11:53,042 --> 01:11:55,166
If I reach the bend
before the car...

853
01:11:56,959 --> 01:11:58,916
Manech will come back alive...

854
01:12:05,667 --> 01:12:07,208
If I reach the bend...

855
01:13:06,334 --> 01:13:09,416
You used to brag
about being one year older than me.

856
01:13:09,834 --> 01:13:11,958
Now I'm older than you.

857
01:13:14,334 --> 01:13:16,916
The man who gave you his glove
is called Poux.

858
01:13:17,750 --> 01:13:19,124
Célestin Poux.

859
01:13:19,417 --> 01:13:20,999
Funny, isn't it?

860
01:13:23,375 --> 01:13:27,333
The man I hired to find him is Pire.

861
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:29,749
Germain Pire.

862
01:13:31,334 --> 01:13:32,749
Strange name, too.

863
01:13:33,542 --> 01:13:37,041
Either way, he hasn't found him.
Nor the Corsican's whore.

864
01:13:39,917 --> 01:13:41,958
The wire's snapped, Manech,

865
01:13:43,084 --> 01:13:44,624
but I'm not giving up.

866
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:49,458
I still believe
that Tina Lombardi's a lead.

867
01:13:51,459 --> 01:13:53,541
I need to be sure.

868
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,374
You understand, right?

869
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:00,916
That's why
I must find Célestin Poux.

870
01:14:06,167 --> 01:14:08,458
You can be really annoying,
you know.

871
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:13,124
We would be
so much better in Brittany.

872
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:18,083
Let's go, Mathilde.

873
01:14:19,792 --> 01:14:21,541
You'll catch cold.

874
01:14:49,584 --> 01:14:50,374
Thouvenel!

875
01:14:54,875 --> 01:14:56,416
What do you want?

876
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:05,708
Who are you?

877
01:15:09,834 --> 01:15:11,749
Was it you who phoned?

878
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:14,833
Who are you?

879
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:47,332
The days go by.
Still no news of Célestin Poux.

880
01:15:47,625 --> 01:15:49,624
Mathilde's sadness is overwhelming.

881
01:15:50,875 --> 01:15:53,582
She must eat.
She's making herself ill.

882
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:55,666
Leave her the marrowbone.

883
01:16:02,417 --> 01:16:05,457
Her sadness is beginning
to rub off on us.

884
01:16:10,167 --> 01:16:11,249
And so,

885
01:16:11,708 --> 01:16:14,916
in the middle of the night
on the 1 5th of September, 1920,

886
01:16:15,167 --> 01:16:16,874
the wire is re-tied.

887
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:39,374
"Victory!
I've finally found the roaming Poux.

888
01:16:39,542 --> 01:16:41,666
"Sent by the grace of God
and Davidson motors.

889
01:16:41,833 --> 01:16:44,832
"All expenses paid, of course.
Germain Pire."

890
01:16:47,083 --> 01:16:49,499
Célestin Poux, Terror of the Tarmac!

891
01:16:50,125 --> 01:16:51,499
The ad was yours?

892
01:16:51,667 --> 01:16:54,499
Mathilde tightly clasps her hands,

893
01:16:54,750 --> 01:16:57,332
to keep from shaking and crying

894
01:16:57,625 --> 01:17:00,041
and making a fool of herself.

895
01:17:01,958 --> 01:17:04,082
I didn't actually see
your fiancé get hit.

896
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:05,582
I went to get the stew

897
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:07,957
and ran into Lebègue,
a guy I met in the Vosges.

898
01:17:08,125 --> 01:17:12,249
A native of the Meuse.
Or rather a naïve of the Meuse.

899
01:17:12,458 --> 01:17:15,957
Even so, he could tell good coffee
from a stomach remedy.

900
01:17:16,125 --> 01:17:19,874
I know. I tried to sell him
a mixture of coffee and charcoal

901
01:17:20,042 --> 01:17:21,832
in exchange for
some Dutch tobacco.

902
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,832
So, the last time you saw Manech,

903
01:17:24,625 --> 01:17:26,124
he was alive?

904
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,249
You couldn't miss him.

905
01:17:30,417 --> 01:17:32,624
Carving Ms on a burnt tree trunk,

906
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,082
smack in the middle
of no-man's-land.

907
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:38,832
He carved three Ms
before the albatross got him.

908
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:41,707
Albatross!

909
01:17:42,250 --> 01:17:43,749
"Albatross.

910
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:46,249
"Great sweeping sea bird,

911
01:17:46,417 --> 01:17:49,332
"indolent traveling companion,

912
01:17:49,917 --> 01:17:51,791
"gliding with ships

913
01:17:51,958 --> 01:17:53,541
"upon bitter deep."

914
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:57,166
It's a poem by Baudelaire.

915
01:17:57,417 --> 01:17:59,541
It was also a Jerry bomber.

916
01:17:59,792 --> 01:18:01,582
The machine gun was at the rear.

917
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:04,416
We couldn't shoot yet
through the propeller.

918
01:18:49,167 --> 01:18:51,457
It was you who gave him the glove?

919
01:18:53,042 --> 01:18:54,749
A thick woolen red one.

920
01:18:54,958 --> 01:18:58,666
My fiancée spent her time
knitting scarves and mittens for me.

921
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:01,832
I traded them
with frostbitten Senegalese

922
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,374
in exchange for Germans' gold teeth.

923
01:19:04,833 --> 01:19:07,124
I melted them down
after the Armistice.

924
01:19:07,292 --> 01:19:08,666
They paid for my Harley.

925
01:19:09,417 --> 01:19:10,457
But...

926
01:19:11,333 --> 01:19:13,624
are you sure Manech's dead?

927
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:18,541
A comrade told me,
with a wound like that...

928
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,082
he didn't stand a chance.

929
01:19:22,375 --> 01:19:26,499
I only saw three of them get killed
with my own eyes.

930
01:19:26,792 --> 01:19:29,999
I surrender!

931
01:19:30,208 --> 01:19:31,291
Don't shoot!

932
01:19:31,917 --> 01:19:33,791
I beg you! I surrender!

933
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:36,249
Let me through!

934
01:19:36,542 --> 01:19:38,166
I'm on your side!

935
01:19:44,583 --> 01:19:47,166
I'm not French, I'm Corsican!

936
01:19:47,417 --> 01:19:49,124
I've nothing against you!

937
01:19:49,667 --> 01:19:50,999
Poor bastard.

938
01:19:53,583 --> 01:19:55,124
So, he's not French!

939
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:58,249
Let's cancel his birth certificate.

940
01:20:04,208 --> 01:20:06,541
A French corporal dealt with him...

941
01:20:06,958 --> 01:20:09,874
Thouvenel. A trigger-happy swine!

942
01:20:10,958 --> 01:20:13,749
He had a heart made of stone,
but a sharp eye.

943
01:20:15,042 --> 01:20:16,332
Poor bastard!

944
01:20:18,292 --> 01:20:19,957
I guess you like it.

945
01:20:20,333 --> 01:20:22,541
I'd kill my parents for a good stew!

946
01:20:23,333 --> 01:20:24,832
Don't worry, he's an orphan.

947
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,749
The same goes for truffles.

948
01:20:26,917 --> 01:20:30,332
If you like truffles,
I have one from Périgord...

949
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:32,624
Which ones did you see die?

950
01:20:33,667 --> 01:20:35,207
The one with gangrene.

951
01:20:36,583 --> 01:20:37,374
Six-Sous.

952
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:39,249
Yes, the welder.

953
01:20:40,667 --> 01:20:42,041
Comrades...

954
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,416
Before dying...

955
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:46,332
I have a final request.

956
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:48,999
I want to piss standing up.

957
01:20:49,333 --> 01:20:50,832
Like a man!

958
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,791
And then, you can fire away
to your heart's content!

959
01:20:57,875 --> 01:21:02,749
So long to life, so long to love

960
01:21:02,917 --> 01:21:06,791
So long to all those women

961
01:21:08,125 --> 01:21:09,666
It's all over

962
01:21:10,417 --> 01:21:12,791
Done forever

963
01:21:14,083 --> 01:21:17,124
This shameful war

964
01:21:17,458 --> 01:21:21,457
At Craonne, on the plateau

965
01:21:21,625 --> 01:21:25,499
That's where we'll leave our skins

966
01:21:25,667 --> 01:21:28,874
For we've all been sentenced

967
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:34,416
We are the sacrificed

968
01:21:42,375 --> 01:21:43,374
And Bastoche?

969
01:21:43,542 --> 01:21:45,291
He was so well hidden,

970
01:21:45,583 --> 01:21:47,416
we couldn't locate him.

971
01:21:47,708 --> 01:21:49,999
Even at dawn,
when he answered roll call,

972
01:21:50,333 --> 01:21:53,791
no one knew where he was.
A ventriloquist!

973
01:21:53,958 --> 01:21:55,791
No, he was a carpenter.

974
01:21:56,375 --> 01:21:57,249
No matter.

975
01:21:57,625 --> 01:22:01,457
He was shot down by the Albatross,
along with your fiancé.

976
01:22:25,292 --> 01:22:28,916
The Albatross caught fire
and crashed on the enemy line.

977
01:22:29,083 --> 01:22:30,541
Return to sender.

978
01:22:33,708 --> 01:22:36,166
What about the Dordogne farmer?

979
01:22:36,333 --> 01:22:39,499
He played dead from the beginning.
Not that it saved him.

980
01:22:40,167 --> 01:22:43,582
The Jerries didn't appreciate
the grenade.

981
01:22:43,875 --> 01:22:46,832
Don't look!
It'll only make it worse.

982
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,457
When I got back with the stew,
bullets were flying everywhere.

983
01:22:50,917 --> 01:22:53,332
Heavy shelling had begun.

984
01:23:23,583 --> 01:23:26,332
Damn! No one can imagine
what it's like.

985
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:30,832
Can't move your legs, your heart
beats like a scared animal.

986
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:10,416
Then I saw the Dordogne farmer
shatter into pieces.

987
01:24:17,708 --> 01:24:20,082
Attack,
before we're all slaughtered.

988
01:24:20,958 --> 01:24:22,957
Prepare bayonets!

989
01:24:37,708 --> 01:24:41,332
All that was nothing
compared to what followed.

990
01:24:42,375 --> 01:24:44,082
For France!

991
01:24:45,042 --> 01:24:46,332
Charge!

992
01:25:08,542 --> 01:25:11,416
We'd passed
the five prisoners bodies

993
01:25:11,583 --> 01:25:14,999
when the Jerry machine guns
started spitting bullets.

994
01:25:15,542 --> 01:25:16,791
We were wiped out!

995
01:26:03,125 --> 01:26:06,541
That Lavrouye bastard!
He kept the paper to himself.

996
01:26:06,708 --> 01:26:08,082
Stretcher-bearers!

997
01:26:09,125 --> 01:26:11,166
What paper?

998
01:26:12,083 --> 01:26:13,582
That's all he said.

999
01:26:20,083 --> 01:26:23,832
That evening, there was enough food
to feed an army.

1000
01:26:24,333 --> 01:26:27,416
Favart and Chardolot
were counting losses.

1001
01:26:27,833 --> 01:26:30,749
Why do those five
show up on our battalion list?

1002
01:26:32,125 --> 01:26:33,666
We're only following orders.

1003
01:26:34,375 --> 01:26:35,582
Something stinks here.

1004
01:26:35,833 --> 01:26:38,457
Something stinks?
Lavrouye stinks.

1005
01:26:38,625 --> 01:26:42,541
This food doesn't.
Dig in before it gets cold.

1006
01:26:45,708 --> 01:26:47,082
It's cold!

1007
01:26:47,958 --> 01:26:51,124
So you only saw
three of them get killed.

1008
01:26:51,292 --> 01:26:52,332
With your own eyes.

1009
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,291
False hope
will only make you suffer.

1010
01:26:56,458 --> 01:26:57,624
They're not false!

1011
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:59,249
You'll taste my cake?

1012
01:26:59,417 --> 01:27:00,832
I don't know if I should.

1013
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,791
With a bit of fresh cream.

1014
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,624
If you insist...

1015
01:27:05,625 --> 01:27:07,791
I like people
who appreciate my food.

1016
01:27:10,167 --> 01:27:11,916
I'll put her to bed.

1017
01:27:12,667 --> 01:27:14,624
Let's all get some sleep.

1018
01:27:35,875 --> 01:27:37,416
Slow down!

1019
01:27:40,208 --> 01:27:42,457
You lack control, no style...

1020
01:27:42,625 --> 01:27:45,457
You're better at raking
than skidding!

1021
01:27:45,625 --> 01:27:48,499
Hey, Postman! I'll drop you off
at the next letterbox.

1022
01:27:48,667 --> 01:27:49,499
And my bike?

1023
01:27:49,667 --> 01:27:53,166
Leave it to me. I fought in the war!
I don't have a desk job.

1024
01:27:55,375 --> 01:27:57,707
It's not my fault. I'm asthmatic!

1025
01:27:57,875 --> 01:27:59,707
An asthmatic who rides a bike!

1026
01:27:59,875 --> 01:28:01,999
- By the sea.
- Sure, by the sea!

1027
01:28:02,167 --> 01:28:04,374
Célestin, it's not a sidecar.

1028
01:28:05,917 --> 01:28:08,916
Those men, they never grow up...

1029
01:28:09,083 --> 01:28:11,207
As long as they don't play soldiers.

1030
01:28:12,583 --> 01:28:16,957
"Tell old Bernay... settle up by
March. His manure's too costly..."

1031
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:20,999
He wouldn't write such trivialities.
Don't you agree?

1032
01:28:22,458 --> 01:28:24,249
There must be a code.

1033
01:28:24,417 --> 01:28:25,832
Except lovers' codes

1034
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,624
can't be cracked with brains
or divine intervention.

1035
01:28:32,083 --> 01:28:33,332
And Bastoche?

1036
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:37,541
If he was seen with his German
boots, he must have survived.

1037
01:28:37,833 --> 01:28:39,416
Not so, Miss.

1038
01:28:39,625 --> 01:28:43,582
Gordes didn't let him go over
the top with those boots.

1039
01:28:49,750 --> 01:28:51,374
If the Jerries see these,

1040
01:28:51,792 --> 01:28:54,499
they'll know
you've stripped one of their dead.

1041
01:28:59,125 --> 01:29:01,957
So Tina Lombardi's
on the wrong track.

1042
01:29:03,833 --> 01:29:05,291
The one with the boots

1043
01:29:06,958 --> 01:29:08,332
wasn't Bastoche.

1044
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:09,916
It was Gordes!

1045
01:29:10,083 --> 01:29:11,166
That's right, Miss!

1046
01:29:12,167 --> 01:29:13,916
He was with a boy,

1047
01:29:14,083 --> 01:29:15,791
from the class of '17...
Desrochelles.

1048
01:29:16,583 --> 01:29:19,916
I'd met some stretcher-bearers
who'd just passed them.

1049
01:29:21,250 --> 01:29:22,624
Are you from Bingo?

1050
01:29:23,042 --> 01:29:24,332
Might be.

1051
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:26,541
Tell them Gordes is wounded.

1052
01:29:26,708 --> 01:29:29,916
- He's with a boy who's worse off.
- Desrochelles.

1053
01:29:30,083 --> 01:29:32,207
- They're off to first-aid.
- With German boots!

1054
01:29:32,375 --> 01:29:33,624
Long Live Anarchy!

1055
01:29:35,542 --> 01:29:36,999
Anarchy.

1056
01:29:53,417 --> 01:29:55,207
What's happened, Matti?

1057
01:29:55,750 --> 01:29:56,957
What did I say?

1058
01:29:58,625 --> 01:30:00,124
Open up!

1059
01:30:01,833 --> 01:30:03,541
Be reasonable.

1060
01:30:03,708 --> 01:30:05,666
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

1061
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,082
You've known he's dead
for three years.

1062
01:30:09,250 --> 01:30:10,749
I call that stubbornness.

1063
01:30:11,083 --> 01:30:13,166
No, I call that hope.

1064
01:30:13,458 --> 01:30:14,957
Poux has just killed it.

1065
01:30:18,417 --> 01:30:20,791
If I can do anything...

1066
01:30:24,375 --> 01:30:25,207
You can.

1067
01:30:26,458 --> 01:30:28,666
Take me to Bingo Crépuscule.

1068
01:30:43,042 --> 01:30:45,707
An Indian princess on her elephant.

1069
01:30:46,583 --> 01:30:50,624
With her hunters,
on the Trail of Sorrow.

1070
01:30:51,542 --> 01:30:52,957
It was there!

1071
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:54,416
Right there!

1072
01:30:56,667 --> 01:30:59,041
At a hundred yards, facing Bingo,

1073
01:30:59,667 --> 01:31:02,499
was Erlangen, the Jerry trench.

1074
01:31:03,167 --> 01:31:05,707
Where's the burnt tree trunk?

1075
01:31:05,875 --> 01:31:08,541
All the stumps and debris

1076
01:31:09,250 --> 01:31:12,624
were used to fill in the trenches.

1077
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:17,874
We found the five over there,
under a tarpaulin,

1078
01:31:18,042 --> 01:31:20,166
covered with earth.

1079
01:31:20,542 --> 01:31:22,749
- Not a pretty sight.
- No doubt!

1080
01:31:22,917 --> 01:31:25,041
The youngest was only a boy.

1081
01:31:26,542 --> 01:31:28,791
Was he wearing a glove?

1082
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:30,957
A red, woolen glove?

1083
01:31:31,125 --> 01:31:34,457
They all had
one bandaged hand, but...

1084
01:31:34,625 --> 01:31:38,374
nothing on the other.
I can't remember seeing a glove.

1085
01:31:38,542 --> 01:31:39,291
Athos!

1086
01:31:40,167 --> 01:31:43,041
I don't like him digging like that.

1087
01:31:43,208 --> 01:31:44,541
Around here,

1088
01:31:44,708 --> 01:31:49,124
you never know what junk
you might come across,

1089
01:31:49,292 --> 01:31:51,624
that can blow off an arm or a leg.

1090
01:31:54,375 --> 01:31:55,666
It's the crypt!

1091
01:31:55,958 --> 01:31:59,582
There was a chapel
between the two trenches.

1092
01:32:00,125 --> 01:32:02,374
It was in ruins.

1093
01:32:02,542 --> 01:32:05,166
Incredible.
I don't recognize a thing.

1094
01:32:29,125 --> 01:32:32,249
Could Manech have lost the glove
as he fell?

1095
01:32:33,083 --> 01:32:35,916
It was tightly knitted
and tightly fitted.

1096
01:32:36,083 --> 01:32:40,124
I used the other one in the kitchens
until the end of the war.

1097
01:32:41,250 --> 01:32:43,291
Maybe he took it off to carve?

1098
01:32:45,083 --> 01:32:46,332
I couldn't say.

1099
01:32:46,708 --> 01:32:48,332
But I don't think so.

1100
01:32:48,833 --> 01:32:51,457
What sort of red was it? Bright red?

1101
01:32:52,708 --> 01:32:53,791
A flashy red.

1102
01:32:54,750 --> 01:32:58,332
With white dots.
Looked like maggots on an apple!

1103
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:14,582
Sorry to disturb you like this.

1104
01:33:14,750 --> 01:33:18,499
My husband's family
suffered greatly in the war.

1105
01:33:18,667 --> 01:33:20,791
I didn't want to go over

1106
01:33:20,958 --> 01:33:24,041
to a French soldier's table
in front of him.

1107
01:33:26,042 --> 01:33:27,582
What can you tell me?

1108
01:33:28,250 --> 01:33:30,499
Before dying, my brother Gunther

1109
01:33:30,667 --> 01:33:34,957
saw your fiancé carve
those three letters on a tree.

1110
01:33:35,750 --> 01:33:38,541
He was wearing a red, spotted glove.

1111
01:33:38,708 --> 01:33:41,457
A comrade of Gunther's
told me the story.

1112
01:33:42,292 --> 01:33:45,624
When our plane
shot down your fiancé,

1113
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,041
they were sick to the stomach.

1114
01:33:48,458 --> 01:33:49,874
After that,

1115
01:33:50,042 --> 01:33:51,582
it was a nightmare.

1116
01:34:16,917 --> 01:34:20,791
God spared
that French soldier twice.

1117
01:34:23,792 --> 01:34:27,582
Then... your side attacked.

1118
01:34:28,583 --> 01:34:30,332
They killed my brother.

1119
01:34:32,292 --> 01:34:33,957
He was 23 years old.

1120
01:34:34,583 --> 01:34:37,416
I came to see his cross
at the cemetery.

1121
01:34:37,583 --> 01:34:38,749
I'm sorry.

1122
01:34:40,542 --> 01:34:43,749
Time heals all. You'll see.

1123
01:34:45,917 --> 01:34:48,666
I'll get back,
he'll be getting worried.

1124
01:34:59,125 --> 01:35:00,624
Seems I haven't killed it.

1125
01:35:01,417 --> 01:35:02,207
Pardon?

1126
01:35:02,875 --> 01:35:04,082
Hope!

1127
01:35:19,708 --> 01:35:20,957
What now?

1128
01:35:21,125 --> 01:35:24,166
Tina Lombardi.
She's going to the guillotine!

1129
01:35:24,333 --> 01:35:26,291
They call her the "Officer Killer".

1130
01:35:26,917 --> 01:35:29,541
She's killed Lavrouye and Thouvenel.

1131
01:35:29,708 --> 01:35:32,416
And planned to kill Maréchal Pétain.

1132
01:35:39,542 --> 01:35:42,499
When I think you sat in a wheelchair
to soften me up!

1133
01:36:15,833 --> 01:36:17,332
I'll talk only to you,

1134
01:36:18,833 --> 01:36:20,874
because I know we're very similar.

1135
01:36:21,792 --> 01:36:23,791
We'll leave them alone.

1136
01:36:29,208 --> 01:36:31,166
What I did,
you could've done, too.

1137
01:36:32,125 --> 01:36:33,416
I don't think so.

1138
01:36:35,167 --> 01:36:36,541
I'd be too scared.

1139
01:36:37,083 --> 01:36:38,624
I'm not scared.

1140
01:36:39,875 --> 01:36:41,457
And I regret nothing.

1141
01:36:43,250 --> 01:36:44,541
Except my hair.

1142
01:36:46,125 --> 01:36:49,624
I'll be treated to a bowl-cut
before the execution.

1143
01:36:50,917 --> 01:36:54,374
I'll look like Joan of Arc
when I see my Angel!

1144
01:36:56,375 --> 01:36:58,666
Why did you want to kill Pétain?

1145
01:36:58,917 --> 01:37:01,874
Throwing mutilated soldiers
over the top was his idea.

1146
01:37:02,083 --> 01:37:03,999
Why not Poincaré?

1147
01:37:04,542 --> 01:37:05,957
He refused them a pardon.

1148
01:37:07,333 --> 01:37:08,457
You don't know?

1149
01:37:10,583 --> 01:37:13,541
He did pardon them.
All five!

1150
01:37:14,083 --> 01:37:16,582
It's just a leave.

1151
01:37:16,833 --> 01:37:19,999
Lavrouye kept the paper for himself.

1152
01:37:20,417 --> 01:37:22,374
Why did that dog Lavrouye do that?

1153
01:37:23,375 --> 01:37:26,874
Because dirty dogs play dirty.
That's all.

1154
01:38:00,292 --> 01:38:02,207
Trust me on this.

1155
01:38:02,375 --> 01:38:03,916
I took care of him!

1156
01:38:07,750 --> 01:38:10,624
You and I have been running
the same investigation.

1157
01:38:11,792 --> 01:38:13,416
Each in our own way.

1158
01:38:16,083 --> 01:38:18,374
Looking for survivors from Bingo,

1159
01:38:18,750 --> 01:38:22,332
I picked up a male nurse
who'd treated Angel and the others.

1160
01:38:22,833 --> 01:38:26,291
This guy, Phillipot,
was sure he'd seen one of them.

1161
01:38:26,917 --> 01:38:29,332
A big man, with a head wound.

1162
01:38:29,583 --> 01:38:32,541
He was a big man.
Head wound, German boots...

1163
01:38:32,708 --> 01:38:36,999
He wore German boots and
was carrying a thin-built soldier.

1164
01:38:37,167 --> 01:38:40,291
I think that's about right.
I'm even sure of it.

1165
01:38:40,917 --> 01:38:42,916
A big man, head wound...

1166
01:38:43,583 --> 01:38:46,416
His superior told him
to keep his mouth shut.

1167
01:38:48,708 --> 01:38:51,416
You can imagine
how overwhelmed with hope I was.

1168
01:38:53,458 --> 01:38:56,166
And then, I met the man
who shattered my dreams.

1169
01:38:57,792 --> 01:38:59,582
Chief Sergeant Favart.

1170
01:39:01,333 --> 01:39:05,707
He told me how that pig Thouvenel
had shot my Angel, just like that!

1171
01:39:06,333 --> 01:39:07,874
Like taking a leak.

1172
01:39:13,625 --> 01:39:14,957
I took care of him, too!

1173
01:39:18,083 --> 01:39:19,666
It was an obsession.

1174
01:39:21,083 --> 01:39:23,582
Kill all those who hurt my man.

1175
01:39:28,667 --> 01:39:30,874
Your Angel left you this.

1176
01:39:51,708 --> 01:39:54,499
"Vengeance is pointless.
Try to be happy,

1177
01:39:54,667 --> 01:39:56,582
"and don't ruin your life for me.

1178
01:39:56,750 --> 01:39:58,582
"Your Angel from Hell."

1179
01:40:04,708 --> 01:40:07,374
Departure for Paris,
Platform 2.

1180
01:40:07,667 --> 01:40:11,041
Gordes, the one who switched boots
with Bastoche...

1181
01:40:11,208 --> 01:40:12,457
was he big?

1182
01:40:12,625 --> 01:40:16,332
Biscuit? He was no athlete.
Just a guy like you or me.

1183
01:40:16,542 --> 01:40:18,707
And you have no news
of Desrochelles?

1184
01:40:18,875 --> 01:40:23,332
He didn't make friends easily.
He lived alone with his mother.

1185
01:40:23,583 --> 01:40:26,874
I must go. I'm boarding in an hour
for Venezuela.

1186
01:40:27,833 --> 01:40:29,332
Good luck, Célestin!

1187
01:40:29,500 --> 01:40:30,666
To you too!

1188
01:40:38,750 --> 01:40:41,166
When I think
you hid Poincaré's pardon!

1189
01:40:42,542 --> 01:40:45,957
I didn't want to throw salt
on the wound.

1190
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:47,791
I'd like one last favour.

1191
01:40:48,625 --> 01:40:51,082
I suppose it concerns Bingo-thingy?

1192
01:40:51,625 --> 01:40:52,999
Son of bookseller,
Desrochelles Paul,

1193
01:40:53,167 --> 01:40:54,707
born in Sarreguemines,

1194
01:40:54,875 --> 01:40:57,499
died in February, 1897...

1195
01:40:58,708 --> 01:41:00,249
That's it, Desrochelles Jean!

1196
01:41:00,417 --> 01:41:01,582
What?

1197
01:41:04,083 --> 01:41:05,374
In Saintes.

1198
01:41:06,708 --> 01:41:07,832
In the Charentes.

1199
01:41:12,042 --> 01:41:15,666
Tell me, Mr. Pire, Tina Lombardi...
You had an inkling

1200
01:41:15,833 --> 01:41:17,374
of what she was up to.

1201
01:41:17,583 --> 01:41:19,874
Luckily, your paths didn't cross.

1202
01:41:20,042 --> 01:41:22,707
He who pries, flies,
when danger lurks.

1203
01:41:22,875 --> 01:41:25,249
He who pries, pries,
but, from a distance.

1204
01:41:25,417 --> 01:41:27,749
I've a new lead for you.

1205
01:41:27,917 --> 01:41:31,416
Jean Desrochelles. Evacuated from
the Front on the 7th of January '17.

1206
01:41:31,583 --> 01:41:35,374
His only next of kin was his mother,
the widow Desrochelles.

1207
01:41:35,625 --> 01:41:39,124
She lives at 22 rue de l'Abbaye.
Saintes, in the Charentes.

1208
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:40,957
All the work's been done!

1209
01:41:44,583 --> 01:41:45,874
You've tried to reach me?

1210
01:41:47,375 --> 01:41:50,416
My brother's comrade,
the one I told you about...

1211
01:41:50,583 --> 01:41:54,916
He remembered something
that might interest you.

1212
01:41:55,375 --> 01:41:59,291
The two French soldiers
escorting him that morning,

1213
01:41:59,458 --> 01:42:02,499
wanted to go back through
no-man's-land.

1214
01:42:02,667 --> 01:42:04,874
They saw the prisoners' bodies.

1215
01:42:05,042 --> 01:42:07,499
One was in a kind of small cellar.

1216
01:42:07,667 --> 01:42:10,499
The French soldiers
seemed surprised.

1217
01:42:11,042 --> 01:42:14,332
I don't know if that can help you.

1218
01:42:16,042 --> 01:42:17,041
Thank you.

1219
01:42:21,667 --> 01:42:24,666
"Tell old Bernay
I want to settle up by March.

1220
01:42:24,833 --> 01:42:28,582
"His manure's too costly,
watch out for him."

1221
01:42:30,042 --> 01:42:32,374
"His manure's too costly..."

1222
01:42:32,542 --> 01:42:34,916
There must be a code.

1223
01:42:49,583 --> 01:42:51,291
Your Mr. Pry called!

1224
01:42:51,833 --> 01:42:53,957
He's run into a dead-end in Saintes.

1225
01:42:54,125 --> 01:42:55,207
I know!

1226
01:43:06,875 --> 01:43:08,416
Hello! Go ahead.

1227
01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:11,624
Yes, Miss. I remember you.

1228
01:43:12,208 --> 01:43:15,999
Old Bernay? No, never heard of him.

1229
01:43:17,250 --> 01:43:19,249
Benoît Notre Dame
used the manure from his animals.

1230
01:43:19,417 --> 01:43:21,082
He never bought it!

1231
01:43:21,583 --> 01:43:23,124
Thank you, Father.

1232
01:43:25,042 --> 01:43:26,874
I must decode this letter.

1233
01:43:27,958 --> 01:43:29,749
I think we're getting hot.

1234
01:44:05,875 --> 01:44:08,582
Will be - Bernay - March

1235
01:44:08,792 --> 01:44:10,166
Sell - Everything

1236
01:44:10,333 --> 01:44:11,541
Say - Nothing

1237
01:44:11,708 --> 01:44:13,957
Listen - No one

1238
01:44:14,583 --> 01:44:15,541
Benoît

1239
01:45:06,333 --> 01:45:09,166
Excuse me,
the "End of the World" farm?

1240
01:45:09,667 --> 01:45:11,957
The last house
at the end of the road.

1241
01:45:31,792 --> 01:45:33,291
And if he doesn't come?

1242
01:45:33,708 --> 01:45:35,166
He'll come, don't worry.

1243
01:45:35,333 --> 01:45:36,999
Come back in two hours.

1244
01:46:08,333 --> 01:46:09,624
Hello, Mathilde.

1245
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:12,416
It's dangerous
to want to bring back the dead.

1246
01:46:14,375 --> 01:46:16,707
When I saw your ad in the paper,

1247
01:46:17,125 --> 01:46:19,791
I knew, in time,
the gendarmes would come.

1248
01:46:21,667 --> 01:46:22,832
Don't worry.

1249
01:46:23,458 --> 01:46:25,749
I had the chance
to do away with you...

1250
01:46:25,917 --> 01:46:27,416
I let it go.

1251
01:46:53,625 --> 01:46:56,916
We knew you were a thief.
But a pyromaniac?

1252
01:46:57,167 --> 01:46:58,916
I couldn't kill you.

1253
01:46:59,125 --> 01:47:02,166
Now, even the rabbits and chickens,
my wife has to do it.

1254
01:47:02,333 --> 01:47:03,999
The war's taken it out of me.

1255
01:47:04,167 --> 01:47:06,041
You know what I want to hear.

1256
01:47:07,083 --> 01:47:08,332
Is he alive?

1257
01:47:12,250 --> 01:47:14,541
The last time I saw him,
he wasn't doing well.

1258
01:47:15,875 --> 01:47:17,499
But he's stronger than he looks.

1259
01:47:28,583 --> 01:47:29,916
Don't stay together.

1260
01:47:49,292 --> 01:47:52,624
When things calmed down,
I tried to get some sleep.

1261
01:47:52,958 --> 01:47:55,832
- Gaignard!
- You think we're at the whorehouse?

1262
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,791
- Bouquet!
- What now?

1263
01:47:57,958 --> 01:47:59,416
Notre Dame?

1264
01:48:06,417 --> 01:48:08,791
Then the pimp tried to surrender.

1265
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,541
And the welder
from Paris was killed.

1266
01:48:13,833 --> 01:48:16,166
Your fiancé started carving
on the tree.

1267
01:48:16,708 --> 01:48:18,957
Then,
the Jerries' Albatross arrived.

1268
01:48:32,875 --> 01:48:35,541
I came to,
when the ground started shaking.

1269
01:48:52,583 --> 01:48:56,249
I don't know what happened.
I just saw that trapdoor

1270
01:48:56,417 --> 01:48:57,874
the shell had half-opened.

1271
01:49:15,750 --> 01:49:16,999
For France!

1272
01:49:17,167 --> 01:49:18,499
Charge!

1273
01:49:30,250 --> 01:49:33,166
They entered no-man's-land.
At the second German line,

1274
01:49:33,792 --> 01:49:37,041
the machine guns got them.
A few hours later,

1275
01:49:37,417 --> 01:49:39,082
a voice woke me.

1276
01:49:40,542 --> 01:49:43,124
My God! Bastoche is dead!

1277
01:49:43,375 --> 01:49:44,666
We can't leave him here.

1278
01:49:44,833 --> 01:49:46,916
We'll come back.
He's not going anywhere.

1279
01:49:47,292 --> 01:49:48,874
Bastoche is dead.

1280
01:49:51,750 --> 01:49:53,832
Look, this one's still moving.

1281
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,374
It's the Cornflower.
He's a goner as well.

1282
01:50:13,667 --> 01:50:15,416
A shell had ripped the door off.

1283
01:50:15,875 --> 01:50:17,957
One of the guys arrived,
in bad shape.

1284
01:50:18,125 --> 01:50:19,707
Bastoche is dead!

1285
01:50:26,292 --> 01:50:28,124
We're all going to die.

1286
01:50:29,667 --> 01:50:30,874
I recognized Bastoche's friend.

1287
01:50:31,042 --> 01:50:33,707
The one who'd taken
his German boots.

1288
01:50:45,750 --> 01:50:48,207
After eating, I smoked his tobacco.

1289
01:50:48,917 --> 01:50:50,624
Then, I heard more voices.

1290
01:50:50,917 --> 01:50:52,374
Let's go look over there.

1291
01:50:53,542 --> 01:50:54,707
Look here!

1292
01:50:55,292 --> 01:50:56,582
Damn it!

1293
01:50:58,625 --> 01:51:00,124
It's not the Cornflower.

1294
01:51:04,875 --> 01:51:06,582
What's he doing in there?

1295
01:51:08,167 --> 01:51:09,874
Where's the Dordogne farmer?

1296
01:52:35,125 --> 01:52:37,332
- I'm cold.
- Don't worry.

1297
01:52:57,833 --> 01:52:59,457
He was really messed up,

1298
01:53:00,167 --> 01:53:03,041
but your fiancé wanted to live.
I saw it in his eyes.

1299
01:53:07,750 --> 01:53:10,666
I put him on my shoulders
and set off through the trench.

1300
01:53:15,167 --> 01:53:16,832
He was burning with fever.

1301
01:53:17,667 --> 01:53:19,666
I felt the heat on my back.

1302
01:53:21,250 --> 01:53:23,166
And he was delirious.

1303
01:53:24,750 --> 01:53:26,666
Spoke of a heart
beating in his hand.

1304
01:53:33,958 --> 01:53:35,207
Hey, Corporal!

1305
01:53:35,542 --> 01:53:37,624
Only 500 yards to the hospital.

1306
01:53:37,792 --> 01:53:39,874
Want us to put your friend
on the stretcher?

1307
01:53:40,042 --> 01:53:41,166
No, thanks.

1308
01:53:41,333 --> 01:53:43,749
If you see any officers from Bingo,

1309
01:53:43,917 --> 01:53:48,707
tell them Corporal Gordes has gone
to the hospital with Desrochelles.

1310
01:53:48,875 --> 01:53:50,332
Have it your way!

1311
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,124
I arrived just before the explosion.

1312
01:53:53,292 --> 01:53:56,082
Headquarters had the good idea
of setting up hospital

1313
01:53:56,250 --> 01:53:59,249
in a hangar containing
a hydrogen-packed zeppelin.

1314
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,957
The Cornflower
has just been evacuated.

1315
01:54:10,917 --> 01:54:12,207
Will he make it?

1316
01:54:12,958 --> 01:54:17,416
His hip wound isn't too bad. But
he has a severe case of pneumonia.

1317
01:54:18,958 --> 01:54:22,291
You're both registered
according to your tag numbers.

1318
01:54:22,625 --> 01:54:25,916
I don't want to know anything else.
But good luck anyway!

1319
01:55:15,625 --> 01:55:16,999
Block the pulley!

1320
01:55:52,292 --> 01:55:53,541
Please!

1321
01:56:24,833 --> 01:56:27,499
After that, I walked to Bernay.

1322
01:56:28,333 --> 01:56:30,999
I had no idea if my wife
had received my letter,

1323
01:56:31,167 --> 01:56:33,999
so each day I waited for her
at the bus-stop.

1324
01:56:41,042 --> 01:56:44,166
With the money from the sale,
we bought a farm here.

1325
01:56:44,917 --> 01:56:47,291
The most isolated one we could find.

1326
01:56:47,583 --> 01:56:50,124
They call it "The End of the World".

1327
01:56:58,333 --> 01:56:59,416
That's it.

1328
01:57:02,792 --> 01:57:03,916
Goodbye.

1329
01:57:08,083 --> 01:57:09,291
How strange.

1330
01:57:10,208 --> 01:57:12,749
You shot a hole
right through your lifeline.

1331
01:57:13,167 --> 01:57:14,624
Of course.

1332
01:57:14,958 --> 01:57:18,332
I died. At Bingo Crépuscule,
like your fiancé.

1333
01:57:26,375 --> 01:57:29,582
If ever you find
Jean Desrochelles alive somewhere,

1334
01:57:29,875 --> 01:57:31,332
let me know.

1335
01:57:31,792 --> 01:57:33,207
You know where to find me.

1336
01:57:45,625 --> 01:57:46,707
Make yourself at home!

1337
01:57:46,875 --> 01:57:48,791
At Christmas,
come down the chimney!

1338
01:57:48,958 --> 01:57:50,332
For Miss Mathilde.

1339
01:57:51,208 --> 01:57:53,124
I'll give it to her later.

1340
01:57:53,542 --> 01:57:55,041
If I were you...

1341
01:57:55,500 --> 01:57:57,124
I would wake her up.

1342
01:58:02,583 --> 01:58:03,874
What is it?

1343
01:58:21,833 --> 01:58:23,124
"He's alive.

1344
01:58:24,917 --> 01:58:26,791
"Stay where you are, Mathilde.

1345
01:58:26,958 --> 01:58:28,957
"Just stay where you are.

1346
01:58:29,208 --> 01:58:30,624
"I'm on my way.

1347
01:58:30,958 --> 01:58:32,457
"Germain Pire."

1348
01:58:40,417 --> 01:58:42,291
How silly I am!

1349
01:59:04,875 --> 01:59:07,999
Peerless on the prowl,
faster than a whippet!

1350
01:59:08,500 --> 01:59:11,957
He's well and truly alive,
but he's lost his memory!

1351
01:59:12,208 --> 01:59:16,832
Total amnesia. He even had to learn
to read and write again.

1352
01:59:17,125 --> 01:59:21,291
The psychiatrists treating him
since '17 aren't hopeful.

1353
01:59:21,667 --> 01:59:23,291
But who knows?

1354
01:59:23,458 --> 01:59:27,582
There are as many amnesias
as amnesiacs.

1355
01:59:28,042 --> 01:59:29,082
Where is he?

1356
01:59:29,292 --> 01:59:30,749
In Milly-la-Forêt.

1357
01:59:31,083 --> 01:59:35,332
Orphaned for the second time.
He's just lost his adopted mother.

1358
01:59:38,917 --> 01:59:41,832
Pierre-Marie, do you know Mr. Pire?

1359
01:59:42,417 --> 01:59:43,749
By reputation.

1360
01:59:43,917 --> 01:59:45,082
An honour.

1361
01:59:47,250 --> 01:59:49,624
Mathilde,
I'll believe it when I see it.

1362
01:59:50,083 --> 01:59:51,374
"With my own eyes!"

1363
01:59:51,792 --> 01:59:53,666
When Jean Desrochelles was born,

1364
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,374
his mother was 40,
and had no other children.

1365
01:59:56,542 --> 01:59:58,291
When the gendarmes took him...

1366
01:59:58,542 --> 02:00:00,749
To replenish the troops in Ardennes.

1367
02:00:00,917 --> 02:00:02,457
She became depressed.

1368
02:00:02,750 --> 02:00:05,666
One day,
a comrade of her son visited her...

1369
02:00:06,083 --> 02:00:07,249
Chardolot!

1370
02:00:08,542 --> 02:00:10,499
Unfortunately, it was Jean.

1371
02:00:11,875 --> 02:00:15,374
A shell had got him. He'd already
been dead for a few hours.

1372
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:18,541
I should also tell you...

1373
02:00:19,958 --> 02:00:23,207
Maybe the youngest prisoner
has taken Jean's identity...

1374
02:00:25,917 --> 02:00:27,541
exchanging tag numbers.

1375
02:00:31,458 --> 02:00:34,832
She went off her rocker
the day the hospital rang her,

1376
02:00:35,542 --> 02:00:38,457
asking to come to her son's bedside.

1377
02:00:40,792 --> 02:00:43,041
He's sleeping. I'll leave you.

1378
02:01:06,333 --> 02:01:07,832
Who are you?

1379
02:01:08,333 --> 02:01:10,291
Your mother, my darling.

1380
02:01:11,958 --> 02:01:13,666
I'm your mother.

1381
02:01:14,750 --> 02:01:16,582
I ran my own little investigation.

1382
02:01:16,958 --> 02:01:18,999
Mrs. Desrochelles died
two months ago.

1383
02:01:19,167 --> 02:01:22,041
Run over by a truck
after a fight with a shopkeeper.

1384
02:01:22,208 --> 02:01:23,791
And I'm not guessing!

1385
02:01:24,542 --> 02:01:26,916
- It's in the report.
- We already knew that.

1386
02:01:33,042 --> 02:01:34,749
Don't get upset.

1387
02:01:35,292 --> 02:01:38,999
Mrs. Desrochelles didn't suffer,
she died straight away.

1388
02:01:39,167 --> 02:01:40,582
It's not that.

1389
02:01:41,250 --> 02:01:43,041
I feel so guilty!

1390
02:01:44,542 --> 02:01:47,332
I didn't believe you,
my dear Mathilde!

1391
02:01:47,500 --> 02:01:49,291
I should have known!

1392
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:51,666
I'm so sorry.

1393
02:01:58,958 --> 02:02:02,124
In what she would refer to as
her "Milly Expedition",

1394
02:02:02,292 --> 02:02:05,874
the sun, the sky
and nature are with her.

1395
02:02:06,167 --> 02:02:09,666
As a true lady, she made
every effort to look her best.

1396
02:02:10,083 --> 02:02:11,957
Dressed in white for freshness,

1397
02:02:12,125 --> 02:02:15,791
lipstick for the occasion,
eyebrows shaped.

1398
02:02:15,958 --> 02:02:18,874
But none of that black
which lengthens the eyelashes.

1399
02:02:19,042 --> 02:02:21,332
She knows that tears
can make a mess of it.

1400
02:02:42,708 --> 02:02:44,624
He knows about your visit.

1401
02:02:44,792 --> 02:02:48,124
We said a young girl
he'd dearly loved was coming here.

1402
02:02:48,375 --> 02:02:51,041
He asked your name
and found it very beautiful.

1403
02:02:51,667 --> 02:02:54,291
He's in the garden.
He's waiting for you.

1404
02:05:02,625 --> 02:05:04,374
Does it hurt when you walk?

1405
02:05:12,792 --> 02:05:14,374
Want to see what I'm doing?

1406
02:05:27,583 --> 02:05:29,874
I'll show you later,
when it's finished.

1407
02:05:36,792 --> 02:05:38,249
But why are you crying?

1408
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:47,041
Mathilde leans back
against her chair,

1409
02:05:47,917 --> 02:05:51,582
folds her hands in her lap
and looks at him.

1410
02:05:52,208 --> 02:05:56,416
In the sweetness of the air,
in the light of the garden,

1411
02:05:57,042 --> 02:05:58,874
Mathilde looks at him.

1412
02:05:59,583 --> 02:06:03,249
She looks at him...
