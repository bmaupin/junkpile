1
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,945
My poor baby.

2
00:03:36,852 --> 00:03:39,946
Who has stolen the child's dream?

3
00:03:40,022 --> 00:03:44,288
The mad genius Krank
in his evil scheme.

4
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:47,988
To what vicious depths
will he not descend?

5
00:03:48,063 --> 00:03:50,691
Will the tale turn to tragedy...

6
00:03:50,766 --> 00:03:52,757
or have a happy end?

7
00:04:46,955 --> 00:04:49,116
Step up. Ladies and gentlemen!

8
00:04:49,191 --> 00:04:51,159
Step right up! Come closer.

9
00:04:51,226 --> 00:04:52,887
Don't be afraid.

10
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:55,395
See the strongest man in the world.

11
00:04:55,464 --> 00:04:58,661
Look at those chains.
Made of the same steel...

12
00:04:58,734 --> 00:05:01,464
as that used to lift...

13
00:05:01,537 --> 00:05:02,970
Yes, my friends...

14
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:04,869
The true light is invisible.

15
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,204
Penetrate the corridor of shadows...

16
00:05:07,276 --> 00:05:11,144
and you will enter
the world of the chosen ones.

17
00:05:11,213 --> 00:05:13,272
Renounce the gift of sight.

18
00:05:13,348 --> 00:05:16,215
I know there are sceptics among you...

19
00:05:16,285 --> 00:05:19,220
afraid to share with us
the dead of night.

20
00:05:19,288 --> 00:05:22,223
Be brave.
Renounce your gift of sight.

21
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:25,226
Pluck out your eyes.
Come and join us.

22
00:05:25,294 --> 00:05:27,888
Help us build a better world.

23
00:05:27,963 --> 00:05:32,457
The crusher Bones is going to try
once more to shatter steel...

24
00:05:32,534 --> 00:05:37,471
only using the power
of his mighty arms.

25
00:05:37,539 --> 00:05:40,133
Please, ladies and gentlemen,
l want absolute silence...

26
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:42,040
during the demonstration.

27
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,204
I must beg of you,
for your own safety...

28
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,305
not to look him in the eye...

29
00:05:47,382 --> 00:05:50,749
because his power of concentration
is so great...

30
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:53,913
that he might provoke
a cerebral haemorrhage...

31
00:05:53,989 --> 00:05:55,923
in the weaker ones among you.

32
00:05:55,991 --> 00:05:58,255
Mr. One, ready?
And now, attention!

33
00:06:03,065 --> 00:06:04,726
Little thief!

34
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,894
Stealing money from orphans.
I'll teach you!

35
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,665
Let go of that!

36
00:06:10,906 --> 00:06:13,670
What's going on?
What's the matter?

37
00:06:13,742 --> 00:06:15,676
The poor man's not well.

38
00:09:27,035 --> 00:09:29,970
Don't move!
Don't move or I'll waste you!

39
00:09:46,455 --> 00:09:48,582
Denree!

40
00:09:54,963 --> 00:09:57,124
Kill him!

41
00:10:34,236 --> 00:10:37,694
- Who's that?
- He's the strong man at the fun fair.

42
00:10:37,772 --> 00:10:39,330
I don't know him.

43
00:10:40,575 --> 00:10:42,634
What do you want?

44
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,220
I have lost little brother.

45
00:11:01,196 --> 00:11:03,528
He didn't come all by himself.

46
00:11:19,581 --> 00:11:22,550
Well. Well, kiddies, hard at work?

47
00:11:23,752 --> 00:11:26,687
It looks like you're doing
really well.

48
00:11:26,755 --> 00:11:28,723
Thanks for waiting for us.

49
00:11:30,492 --> 00:11:32,016
Thank you.

50
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:47,565
Just remember.
My ears are so sharp...

51
00:11:47,642 --> 00:11:49,906
that l can hear you think.

52
00:12:00,989 --> 00:12:03,082
Go buy yourself some sweets.

53
00:12:08,797 --> 00:12:10,697
Don't overdo it.

54
00:12:10,765 --> 00:12:12,699
Come on. Move your bum.

55
00:12:15,937 --> 00:12:17,461
Go on. Here.

56
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,733
Move it!

57
00:12:25,146 --> 00:12:27,580
Get the tools and let's beat it.

58
00:12:28,717 --> 00:12:30,981
Move it!

59
00:12:31,052 --> 00:12:33,145
Those rotten Cyclops.

60
00:12:33,221 --> 00:12:36,088
Don't worry.
We know where to find them.

61
00:12:40,595 --> 00:12:42,620
And him? What about him?

62
00:12:42,697 --> 00:12:45,632
You helped us out.
Here. Now we're even.

63
00:12:57,312 --> 00:13:01,305
Hey. Girl. Cyclops.
You know where to find Cyclops?

64
00:13:01,383 --> 00:13:03,078
Will you get lost?

65
00:13:08,923 --> 00:13:10,652
Beat it!

66
00:13:10,725 --> 00:13:12,249
Happy birthday, Uncle dear.

67
00:13:12,327 --> 00:13:14,591
Our wish is most sincere.

68
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:18,121
We hope this cake of ours
will bring you happiness.

69
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:20,463
Good fortune and success.

70
00:13:20,535 --> 00:13:22,469
Wait till the candles are blown out!

71
00:13:22,537 --> 00:13:25,734
In fair or foul weather
We'll always be together.

72
00:13:27,475 --> 00:13:29,534
Happy birthday, Uncle Irvin.

73
00:13:29,611 --> 00:13:31,545
A cake for me?

74
00:13:31,613 --> 00:13:33,547
You're really too kind.

75
00:13:38,053 --> 00:13:40,146
Are you ready, children?

76
00:13:40,221 --> 00:13:42,280
Not you. You've got a cold.

77
00:13:44,092 --> 00:13:45,787
One, two.

78
00:13:49,164 --> 00:13:51,632
What is all this bellowing about?

79
00:13:53,268 --> 00:13:56,567
But, sweetheart,
it's Irvin's birthday.

80
00:13:56,638 --> 00:13:58,503
Irvin's birthday?

81
00:13:58,573 --> 00:14:02,065
Why, of course.
How could l have forgotten?

82
00:14:02,143 --> 00:14:03,872
Let us celebrate.

83
00:14:03,945 --> 00:14:06,209
Let us all make merry.

84
00:14:06,281 --> 00:14:09,978
Everyone, let's shout!
Scream out!

85
00:14:10,051 --> 00:14:13,885
Krank, come back.
I had a thought last night.

86
00:14:13,955 --> 00:14:16,617
If these children
only have nightmares...

87
00:14:16,691 --> 00:14:19,421
it's perhaps
because the evil is in you.

88
00:14:19,494 --> 00:14:22,088
Why not seek the cause
of your torment...

89
00:14:22,163 --> 00:14:24,757
in the molecular study
of your own tears?

90
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,267
Who could make me cry?

91
00:14:27,335 --> 00:14:29,166
Well. Boss...

92
00:14:29,237 --> 00:14:32,172
we could make you cry
with laughter.

93
00:14:36,544 --> 00:14:39,536
I am a gnome a bag of bones.

94
00:14:40,815 --> 00:14:43,079
A man of means and full of beans.

95
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:47,187
The girls in Spain
sing my refrains

96
00:14:48,323 --> 00:14:50,757
I've such a pain
that it's insane.

97
00:15:00,869 --> 00:15:02,769
You mustn't be angry.

98
00:15:02,837 --> 00:15:05,271
Your brothers are doing their best.

99
00:15:11,913 --> 00:15:14,473
My brothers?

100
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:17,143
May I give it a try?

101
00:15:17,218 --> 00:15:19,482
Go ahead, Mollusk.

102
00:15:19,687 --> 00:15:22,815
Once upon a time,
there was an inventor so gifted...

103
00:15:22,891 --> 00:15:25,052
that he could create life.

104
00:15:25,126 --> 00:15:28,391
- Truly remarkable man.
- Ah. A fairy tale.

105
00:15:28,463 --> 00:15:31,591
I can already feel tears
in my eyes.

106
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:34,066
Since he had no wife or children...

107
00:15:34,135 --> 00:15:36,899
he decided to make them
in his laboratory.

108
00:15:36,971 --> 00:15:39,337
He started with his wife
and fashioned her...

109
00:15:39,407 --> 00:15:42,399
into the most beautiful princess
in the world.

110
00:15:42,477 --> 00:15:46,675
Alas, a wicked genetic fairy
cast a spell on the inventor...

111
00:15:46,748 --> 00:15:51,151
so much so that the princess
was only knee-high to a grasshopper.

112
00:15:53,454 --> 00:15:56,651
He then cloned six children
in his own image.

113
00:15:56,724 --> 00:15:59,454
Faithful. Hard working.
They were so alike...

114
00:15:59,527 --> 00:16:01,461
no one could tell them apart.

115
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:05,226
But fate tricked him again,
giving them all sleeping sickness.

116
00:16:06,301 --> 00:16:10,203
Craving someone to talk to,
he grew in a fish tank...

117
00:16:10,271 --> 00:16:12,831
a poor migraine-ridden brain.

118
00:16:12,907 --> 00:16:16,775
And then. At last.
He created his masterpiece...

119
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:20,303
more intelligent than
the most intelligent man on Earth.

120
00:16:20,381 --> 00:16:23,544
But, alas. The inventor
made a serious mistake.

121
00:16:23,618 --> 00:16:27,054
While his creation was intelligent,
he, too, had a defect.

122
00:16:27,121 --> 00:16:29,749
He never, ever had a dream.

123
00:16:29,824 --> 00:16:32,793
You can't imagine
how quickly he grew old...

124
00:16:32,861 --> 00:16:34,954
because he was so unhappy.

125
00:16:42,937 --> 00:16:44,632
Boss.

126
00:16:44,706 --> 00:16:46,435
There!

127
00:16:48,977 --> 00:16:51,207
An eye dropper, quick!

128
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,372
An eye dropper!

129
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:11,565
Then the poor masterpiece
became so crazed...

130
00:17:11,633 --> 00:17:15,000
that he believed
a single tear-drop could save him.

131
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:17,663
And, after committing
many cruel deeds...

132
00:17:17,739 --> 00:17:19,764
he died a horrible death...

133
00:17:19,841 --> 00:17:22,674
never knowing
what it is to dream.

134
00:17:22,744 --> 00:17:24,177
Get out!

135
00:17:24,245 --> 00:17:26,839
All of you, get out!

136
00:17:28,283 --> 00:17:31,446
Good-bye, Uncle. Happy birthday.
See you tonight.

137
00:17:34,355 --> 00:17:36,016
Silence...

138
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,523
you glub!

139
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,786
What do you expect us
to do with that?

140
00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:14,123
I wouldn't waste a nail
to hang it up.

141
00:18:14,195 --> 00:18:16,629
But it's pretty. Isn't it?

142
00:18:16,698 --> 00:18:18,632
Don't get smart with us.

143
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,998
The Picklock won't always
be there to save your behind.

144
00:18:22,403 --> 00:18:23,961
All right. Get lost.

145
00:18:29,544 --> 00:18:32,342
- That's all?
- Afraid so.

146
00:18:32,413 --> 00:18:34,347
If you keep being sassy...

147
00:18:34,415 --> 00:18:35,882
You'll be sorry.

148
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:38,976
There's no shortage
of orphans. Miette.

149
00:18:47,662 --> 00:18:50,028
Listen carefully, Tadpole.

150
00:18:50,098 --> 00:18:52,931
You don't want to go
to the hole, do you?

151
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:56,266
- It's very cold there.
- And pitch black.

152
00:18:56,337 --> 00:18:58,202
And full of spiders.

153
00:18:58,272 --> 00:19:01,264
So give us all the rest.
The rest.

154
00:19:04,579 --> 00:19:06,945
There's a fine lad.

155
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:11,610
See? When you want to.

156
00:19:11,686 --> 00:19:13,916
Now, the second shift.

157
00:19:56,464 --> 00:19:59,490
The neighbourhood's calm, isolated.
But be careful.

158
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:01,899
You never know.
There's a backyard.

159
00:20:01,969 --> 00:20:04,267
You'lI go that way
with all the stuff.

160
00:20:04,338 --> 00:20:06,704
On the landing,
there are three doors.

161
00:20:06,774 --> 00:20:08,708
One is locked from inside.

162
00:20:08,776 --> 00:20:11,438
That's the one that must be forced.

163
00:20:11,512 --> 00:20:13,503
Behind is what interests us.

164
00:20:14,482 --> 00:20:15,915
Here's the prize.

165
00:20:17,185 --> 00:20:20,484
It's identical to the one
where he hides his loot.

166
00:20:26,994 --> 00:20:29,519
The problem with this safe:
It takes two hours to crack it.

167
00:20:29,597 --> 00:20:31,622
Two hours?
We're going to get caught.

168
00:20:31,699 --> 00:20:35,829
We have no choice, unless you know
someone capable of carrying it.

169
00:20:50,318 --> 00:20:51,910
Somebody got in.

170
00:20:54,922 --> 00:20:57,220
- You big idiot!
- He's right here now.

171
00:20:57,291 --> 00:21:00,488
Do l pay you to sleepwalk?
Who is this guy?

172
00:21:00,561 --> 00:21:02,654
- Don't ask me.
- L know who he is.

173
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:06,166
The strong man at the fair,
the one who breaks his chains.

174
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,500
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

175
00:23:06,988 --> 00:23:08,785
Nice going, Mr. One.

176
00:23:08,856 --> 00:23:11,791
One don't like whistles.
One not thief.

177
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:15,852
A thief? Who's a thief?
We're not stealing, just borrowing.

178
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,591
What he said?

179
00:23:17,665 --> 00:23:21,260
He said you can take it back.
It just won't be as heavy.

180
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,704
- The true light.
- Little brother.

181
00:23:28,776 --> 00:23:32,974
Renounce the gift of sight
and penetrate the corridor of shadows...

182
00:23:33,047 --> 00:23:34,810
the world of the blind.

183
00:23:34,882 --> 00:23:38,716
That guy is crazy.
The Octopus will kill us.

184
00:23:38,786 --> 00:23:41,755
Tell her I'll bring him back.
I won't be long.

185
00:23:41,822 --> 00:23:44,985
Help us build a better world...

186
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:47,994
or we shall witness
a reign of terror.

187
00:23:48,062 --> 00:23:51,327
One! Where do you think you're going?

188
00:23:51,399 --> 00:23:54,334
Cyclops truck.
Denree, little brother.

189
00:23:54,402 --> 00:23:56,336
What about the truck?

190
00:23:57,538 --> 00:23:59,096
Cyclops truck.

191
00:24:00,841 --> 00:24:02,570
Kidnap Denree.

192
00:24:02,643 --> 00:24:04,577
Kidnap little brother.

193
00:24:04,645 --> 00:24:08,604
You know something?
You won't find Cyclops truck like that.

194
00:24:08,683 --> 00:24:11,584
When you get there,
someone will have eaten Denree.

195
00:24:11,652 --> 00:24:14,086
The wolf will have eaten him.

196
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:19,357
Take a break.
No use wearing out your shoes.

197
00:24:19,427 --> 00:24:21,861
I know where the truck's going.

198
00:24:25,499 --> 00:24:28,991
Miette and One together?

199
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,765
And then what?

200
00:24:30,838 --> 00:24:33,932
And anyway. How old
was this brother of yours?

201
00:24:37,545 --> 00:24:39,206
Little, little brother.

202
00:24:42,016 --> 00:24:43,711
Found him...

203
00:24:44,852 --> 00:24:46,877
one night...

204
00:24:46,954 --> 00:24:50,117
on his rubbish bin, crying.

205
00:24:51,792 --> 00:24:53,384
One comes close.

206
00:24:55,429 --> 00:24:57,124
Discover...

207
00:25:00,134 --> 00:25:02,694
Okay. L can guess the rest.

208
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:06,228
He's just like l thought.
He's too little to bother.

209
00:25:06,307 --> 00:25:09,242
Let's go.
We have to get out of here.

210
00:25:18,652 --> 00:25:20,517
Stupid!

211
00:25:20,588 --> 00:25:22,647
Imbecile! Idiot!

212
00:25:25,793 --> 00:25:28,728
Have you finished?
My crystal glasses are broken!

213
00:25:28,796 --> 00:25:30,730
You'll crack my chandelier!

214
00:25:39,006 --> 00:25:40,974
Are you calmer now?

215
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:45,478
One look for Denree.

216
00:25:57,024 --> 00:25:58,548
See you.

217
00:26:23,284 --> 00:26:25,309
Oh. Come on, fat head.

218
00:26:27,288 --> 00:26:29,984
- Where did those brats go?
- L don't know.

219
00:26:30,057 --> 00:26:33,185
It's the big guy's fault.
Miette's different since he came.

220
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:37,492
Does he have all the jewels?
That's all he's interested in?

221
00:26:37,565 --> 00:26:40,363
You had big ideas?
Poor little Tadpole.

222
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:44,063
You haven't fallen in love. Too.
Like the others? Get to bed!

223
00:26:44,138 --> 00:26:46,572
- Filthy brats.
- All the same.

224
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,074
We really can't count on them.

225
00:26:49,143 --> 00:26:51,907
- Raise crows, they'll rip out...
- Your eyes.

226
00:26:51,979 --> 00:26:56,313
- It's the best ones who want to go.
- It's not the first time it's happened.

227
00:26:56,383 --> 00:26:58,408
It's always the same old story.

228
00:26:58,486 --> 00:27:01,751
- Remember little Lucas six years ago?
- And Marcus before.

229
00:27:01,822 --> 00:27:04,313
Yes, Marcus.
I'd almost forgotten him.

230
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:12,194
- When we think...
- Of everything we've done for them.

231
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:16,158
And if she had an accident?

232
00:27:22,643 --> 00:27:24,736
You never know.

233
00:28:00,648 --> 00:28:04,049
At that moment. The winkles
suddenly break into a dance...

234
00:28:04,118 --> 00:28:07,747
then cast off their shells
and begin to use them as megaphones...

235
00:28:07,821 --> 00:28:09,413
to announce the concert.

236
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,355
Winkles. Winkles.
Shells. Shells.

237
00:28:11,425 --> 00:28:15,691
And then, at that moment...

238
00:28:15,763 --> 00:28:18,732
all the winkles
cast off their shells...

239
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,064
and use them as megaphones
to announce the concert.

240
00:28:22,136 --> 00:28:25,765
The winkles?
The winkles cast off their shells?

241
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:27,568
Please continue.

242
00:28:27,641 --> 00:28:30,439
Continue, and with colours as well.

243
00:28:30,511 --> 00:28:32,103
Yes. Yes. Yes.

244
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:35,876
Then the hammerhead shark plays
xylophone with the catfish bones.

245
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:39,283
The walrus plays
the Jew's harp with the...

246
00:28:39,353 --> 00:28:41,184
the sperm whale's suspenders.

247
00:28:41,255 --> 00:28:44,247
The sea is blue like the sky...

248
00:28:44,325 --> 00:28:47,089
and the sky is blue
like the South Seas.

249
00:28:47,161 --> 00:28:50,597
And l don't know
if I'm swimming in the sky or...

250
00:28:51,665 --> 00:28:54,293
or flying at the bottom
of the sea.

251
00:28:54,368 --> 00:28:56,768
I swear it gives me the shivers.

252
00:28:57,638 --> 00:29:01,199
Shivers? Shivers all over.

253
00:29:01,275 --> 00:29:04,073
And igloos?
Oh, yes, tell me about the igloos.

254
00:29:04,144 --> 00:29:07,011
Igloos that turn into mushrooms.

255
00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:21,424
Ah. It's you. My boy.
I was expecting you.

256
00:29:21,495 --> 00:29:25,295
Not so loud. Turn it down.
The boss might hear you.

257
00:29:25,366 --> 00:29:29,302
The boss? He's out of a test tube,
like all of us.

258
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:32,305
Lay the boy in the sarcophagus
and come here.

259
00:29:37,311 --> 00:29:38,903
But before.

260
00:29:40,881 --> 00:29:42,576
Well, you promised me...

261
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,675
What's tormenting you, my son?

262
00:29:46,387 --> 00:29:50,653
Well, this story that among us
there's an original clone...

263
00:29:50,724 --> 00:29:52,851
different from the others.

264
00:29:52,926 --> 00:29:54,518
Is that true?

265
00:29:54,595 --> 00:29:58,031
Of course it's true. The others
are nothing but cheap copies...

266
00:29:58,098 --> 00:30:01,261
while the original one is unique.

267
00:30:02,336 --> 00:30:04,031
- Unique?
- Yes.

268
00:30:04,104 --> 00:30:06,231
And do you know who it is?

269
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:10,572
Do you really want to know?
Connect yourself to the child.

270
00:30:14,014 --> 00:30:16,676
- To the child?
- Yes.

271
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:20,379
Connect myself to the child?
But l can't.

272
00:30:21,622 --> 00:30:23,055
It's forbidden.

273
00:30:23,123 --> 00:30:24,954
Exactly.

274
00:30:25,025 --> 00:30:29,223
The others wouldn't dare,
but you, you can do it...

275
00:30:29,296 --> 00:30:31,196
because you're the original.

276
00:30:31,265 --> 00:30:32,732
Me?

277
00:30:35,102 --> 00:30:36,831
I'm the original?

278
00:30:37,971 --> 00:30:41,532
But it's not lonely
being the original?

279
00:30:41,608 --> 00:30:45,044
All the penguins, the centipedes.
Everyone applauds.

280
00:30:45,112 --> 00:30:48,570
Except, even if you climb
to the treetops...

281
00:30:48,649 --> 00:30:51,516
it's impossible to catch
the candy floss.

282
00:30:51,585 --> 00:30:54,645
And so, everybody climbs
to the top of the mountain...

283
00:30:54,722 --> 00:30:57,987
except the giraffes who, of course,
stay in one spot...

284
00:30:58,058 --> 00:30:59,650
munching the clouds.

285
00:31:00,994 --> 00:31:02,427
Sleep.

286
00:31:03,497 --> 00:31:05,431
Sleep, my little one.

287
00:31:08,402 --> 00:31:10,870
I am the sandman...

288
00:31:10,938 --> 00:31:12,872
and you can't resist me.

289
00:31:14,074 --> 00:31:17,339
Your eyelids are so heavy.

290
00:31:17,411 --> 00:31:19,402
Sleep. My little one.

291
00:31:26,153 --> 00:31:27,780
The snowflakes evaporate...

292
00:31:27,855 --> 00:31:30,756
and then turn into hailstones.

293
00:31:32,025 --> 00:31:33,617
In the farmyards...

294
00:31:37,364 --> 00:31:40,959
the turkeys scramble towards...

295
00:31:45,339 --> 00:31:46,931
the hailstones.

296
00:31:55,015 --> 00:31:57,142
The better to peck them?

297
00:31:57,217 --> 00:32:00,209
And then when the children's voices
cry for help...

298
00:32:00,287 --> 00:32:02,050
the chickens are merciless.

299
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:17,502
There.

300
00:32:17,571 --> 00:32:20,301
Now he's going to come around
very nicely.

301
00:32:20,374 --> 00:32:22,899
- Who, the boss?
- No. The child.

302
00:32:22,976 --> 00:32:25,069
He's a real nightmare factory.

303
00:32:26,313 --> 00:32:29,805
- What's that? A fuse blew!
- Perfect.

304
00:32:36,056 --> 00:32:38,490
Be careful.
Someone will hear you.

305
00:32:45,566 --> 00:32:48,034
It's hard to be original.

306
00:32:48,101 --> 00:32:51,696
Now, throw this message...
Uh, bottle into the sea.

307
00:32:51,772 --> 00:32:53,831
- Yes.
- Go on!

308
00:33:03,116 --> 00:33:08,554
May someone find my plea
to get it over with.

309
00:34:13,687 --> 00:34:15,177
L...

310
00:34:15,255 --> 00:34:17,086
Gabriel Marie...

311
00:34:19,393 --> 00:34:23,386
l came into this world
with open eyes...

312
00:34:24,531 --> 00:34:26,965
but l saw a world...

313
00:34:27,034 --> 00:34:29,969
that was a world of dogs.

314
00:34:30,037 --> 00:34:31,629
Litter of dogs!

315
00:34:33,707 --> 00:34:36,267
And so, the creator...

316
00:34:36,343 --> 00:34:39,608
sent me down here to Earth...

317
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:43,810
to recover the power...

318
00:34:43,884 --> 00:34:47,376
that men have illegally seized.

319
00:34:48,855 --> 00:34:51,289
My brothers...

320
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:55,488
you who have joined me
in this struggle...

321
00:34:55,562 --> 00:34:59,794
understand that together
we must fight...

322
00:34:59,866 --> 00:35:01,959
human beings...

323
00:35:02,035 --> 00:35:05,232
from their own grounds.

324
00:35:05,305 --> 00:35:07,296
The world...

325
00:35:07,374 --> 00:35:09,842
of appearances.

326
00:35:31,164 --> 00:35:34,327
I thought we had agreed
on half a dozen.

327
00:35:34,401 --> 00:35:38,428
But you know it's becoming
more and more difficult.

328
00:35:38,505 --> 00:35:41,474
People are suspicious.
They've put up posters.

329
00:35:42,743 --> 00:35:46,770
In any case. This batch
is as fresh as they come.

330
00:35:46,847 --> 00:35:50,180
Not one of them
is over five years oId.

331
00:35:55,188 --> 00:35:58,988
Listen. Let us have
maybe a couple of hours...

332
00:35:59,059 --> 00:36:01,357
and we'll sort this thing out.

333
00:36:15,242 --> 00:36:18,177
Only the third eye...

334
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,744
will enable you to enter...

335
00:36:22,816 --> 00:36:26,183
the world of appearances.

336
00:36:26,253 --> 00:36:27,720
But beware...

337
00:36:29,556 --> 00:36:34,619
because this sordid world
of temptation and perversion...

338
00:36:34,694 --> 00:36:38,721
is also the world of desire.

339
00:36:40,634 --> 00:36:43,967
Try. Brother Angel Joseph...

340
00:36:45,172 --> 00:36:47,572
to discover it...

341
00:36:47,641 --> 00:36:50,109
without your losing sight...

342
00:36:50,177 --> 00:36:52,202
of the only true light.

343
00:36:54,147 --> 00:36:55,739
Be strong.

344
00:36:57,551 --> 00:36:59,348
My brothers...

345
00:36:59,419 --> 00:37:01,444
our grace...

346
00:37:01,521 --> 00:37:04,649
our great superior race...

347
00:37:04,724 --> 00:37:07,659
shall reign once more...

348
00:37:07,727 --> 00:37:09,888
on Earth!

349
00:37:10,964 --> 00:37:12,795
From that day on...

350
00:37:12,866 --> 00:37:15,027
our faithful third eye...

351
00:37:15,102 --> 00:37:17,662
will become useless...

352
00:37:17,737 --> 00:37:20,570
as the world of appearances...

353
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,837
will be abolished.

354
00:37:25,612 --> 00:37:27,136
It's Denree.

355
00:37:28,482 --> 00:37:31,713
I see!

356
00:37:36,189 --> 00:37:38,953
What's that?

357
00:37:39,025 --> 00:37:41,459
That, Brother Angel Joseph...

358
00:37:41,528 --> 00:37:43,462
is a female.

359
00:37:44,498 --> 00:37:47,160
- A female.
- Do you have a problem?

360
00:37:55,242 --> 00:37:56,800
What's that?

361
00:37:56,877 --> 00:37:59,141
That is a condemned man.

362
00:38:02,649 --> 00:38:05,083
Take them. Go on!

363
00:38:05,152 --> 00:38:08,087
Come back when those idiots
have had enough.

364
00:38:12,058 --> 00:38:14,993
Search her!

365
00:38:15,061 --> 00:38:17,427
What is it?

366
00:38:22,202 --> 00:38:23,692
Kill her!

367
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:25,397
She's clean.

368
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:28,999
Then tomorrow night at Pier 24.

369
00:38:45,091 --> 00:38:46,615
100,000.

370
00:38:49,029 --> 00:38:50,963
We'll never get half that.

371
00:38:52,299 --> 00:38:54,358
One more scrap of information.

372
00:38:56,536 --> 00:38:59,232
A girl in a red dress...

373
00:38:59,306 --> 00:39:00,898
with a big moron.

374
00:39:01,875 --> 00:39:04,537
We found these on them.

375
00:39:04,611 --> 00:39:07,546
But there was much more in the...

376
00:39:08,481 --> 00:39:10,415
What'll you do with them?

377
00:39:20,293 --> 00:39:24,024
A midnight snack for the fishes,
tonight. Pier 24.

378
00:39:24,097 --> 00:39:26,088
A midnight snack for the fishes.

379
00:39:29,402 --> 00:39:31,870
- Irvin?
- Such a migraine.

380
00:39:33,173 --> 00:39:35,266
You know all about feelings.

381
00:39:36,676 --> 00:39:38,871
Won't you try to help me?

382
00:39:38,945 --> 00:39:43,507
Won't you explain why all those children
only have nightmares?

383
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:45,778
'Cause you were their nightmare.

384
00:39:45,852 --> 00:39:48,946
You can persecute
all the children in the world...

385
00:39:49,022 --> 00:39:51,456
but there's one thing
you'll never have.

386
00:39:51,524 --> 00:39:53,549
- What?
- A soul.

387
00:39:57,597 --> 00:40:00,532
Because you believe you have one?

388
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,693
You don't even have a body.

389
00:40:02,769 --> 00:40:06,796
He who created us
made us all monsters.

390
00:40:06,873 --> 00:40:10,604
No, Krank, you're wrong.
You are the only monster here.

391
00:40:10,677 --> 00:40:13,373
Be quiet!
He's the only one responsible.

392
00:40:13,446 --> 00:40:16,813
For that, l say I'm innocent.
I'm innocent!

393
00:40:28,228 --> 00:40:29,718
Anyway...

394
00:40:32,499 --> 00:40:35,491
l thank you for your help.

395
00:40:35,568 --> 00:40:39,402
Hurry up! And don't break
any of the baubles.

396
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:43,436
Well done.
And don't cut yourself.

397
00:40:49,582 --> 00:40:52,346
Are you sure that we're doing
the right thing?

398
00:40:52,419 --> 00:40:54,683
Of course, my pet.
All children love it.

399
00:40:54,754 --> 00:40:56,449
Lift your elbow.

400
00:40:56,523 --> 00:40:58,548
Why worry, Krank?

401
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:01,651
If you're sincere.
You have nothing to lose.

402
00:41:23,616 --> 00:41:25,675
How are you, Marcello?

403
00:41:28,788 --> 00:41:30,483
What's it to you?

404
00:41:31,558 --> 00:41:34,891
We need you. Marcello,
and your creepy-crawlies.

405
00:41:34,961 --> 00:41:37,896
Have you still got the knack?

406
00:41:37,964 --> 00:41:40,057
No, pIease, not again.

407
00:41:40,133 --> 00:41:41,862
I paid enough already.

408
00:41:43,703 --> 00:41:46,638
- Nice place...
- You've got here. Marcello.

409
00:41:49,576 --> 00:41:52,875
I'm glad to see
it hasn't changed much.

410
00:42:04,357 --> 00:42:07,292
You know, l never liked
that blue cage.

411
00:42:09,596 --> 00:42:12,531
You were always so kind
to us, Marcello.

412
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:15,261
- It's only fair...
- That we look after you...

413
00:42:15,335 --> 00:42:16,768
Today.

414
00:42:18,304 --> 00:42:21,740
- A little girl in a red dress.
- With a big moron.

415
00:42:21,808 --> 00:42:23,605
We want him.

416
00:42:23,676 --> 00:42:26,110
And what do l do with her?

417
00:42:28,014 --> 00:42:30,983
A midnight snack for the fishes.

418
00:43:09,823 --> 00:43:11,757
Come on, my little flea.

419
00:43:15,195 --> 00:43:16,662
There. There.

420
00:43:16,729 --> 00:43:18,663
Easy does it.

421
00:43:18,731 --> 00:43:20,892
Midnight snack for the fishes.

422
00:45:36,436 --> 00:45:40,736
Will you shut up, you idiots?

423
00:45:52,819 --> 00:45:55,379
- It wasn't me.
- L don't care.

424
00:45:55,455 --> 00:45:58,618
Work this out among yourselves.

425
00:46:01,728 --> 00:46:03,821
How dare you hit the original.

426
00:46:03,896 --> 00:46:06,330
You, the original?
Have you looked in the mirror lately?

427
00:46:37,864 --> 00:46:39,957
Miette...

428
00:46:40,033 --> 00:46:43,434
One will die?

429
00:46:43,503 --> 00:46:46,768
You're born in the gutter.
You end up in the port.

430
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:52,734
Miette too little.

431
00:46:54,881 --> 00:46:57,349
Not as little as all that.

432
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:12,722
Five thousand on the kid.

433
00:47:12,799 --> 00:47:15,165
Ten thousand on the monster.

434
00:47:22,008 --> 00:47:25,171
There are pebbles in the meat pie.

435
00:47:25,244 --> 00:47:28,145
There are pebbles, bits of...

436
00:47:47,366 --> 00:47:50,199
- Did you hear anything?
- Just them crazy birds.

437
00:47:50,269 --> 00:47:53,204
- There's something over there.
- L don't see anything.

438
00:48:27,273 --> 00:48:31,141
- Who is that guy there?
- What's all that monkey business?

439
00:48:36,516 --> 00:48:37,949
Well, Brutus.

440
00:48:40,153 --> 00:48:43,816
- L can't see anything now.
- Don't you like the music?

441
00:48:45,391 --> 00:48:47,154
What you doing?

442
00:48:49,729 --> 00:48:51,321
I can't see.

443
00:49:39,579 --> 00:49:41,911
I don't want to be dead.

444
00:49:47,587 --> 00:49:49,612
Jump! Go on! Jump!

445
00:49:51,624 --> 00:49:53,216
Save Miette!

446
00:49:53,292 --> 00:49:54,884
Hurry! Jump!

447
00:51:24,383 --> 00:51:28,979
Found, West Pier.
Eve of St. John.

448
00:51:46,572 --> 00:51:48,802
Oh, it's a miracle!

449
00:51:48,874 --> 00:51:50,739
She's come to.

450
00:51:52,244 --> 00:51:54,007
Spit!

451
00:51:55,915 --> 00:51:58,679
Feel better? Look at me.

452
00:51:58,751 --> 00:52:00,514
Are you alI right?

453
00:52:00,586 --> 00:52:03,350
You're very lucky that l came by.

454
00:52:05,324 --> 00:52:07,485
Haven't l seen you somewhere?

455
00:52:08,594 --> 00:52:10,186
I doubt it.

456
00:52:11,597 --> 00:52:13,360
No one ever sees me.

457
00:52:14,734 --> 00:52:16,668
I'm always underwater.

458
00:52:16,736 --> 00:52:18,431
Why?

459
00:52:18,504 --> 00:52:21,098
It's dangerous up there.

460
00:52:22,541 --> 00:52:24,702
- He wants to kill me.
- Who?

461
00:52:28,414 --> 00:52:30,348
I can't remember anything.

462
00:52:31,951 --> 00:52:34,044
Some people lose their marbles.

463
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,213
And me, I've lost my memory.

464
00:52:36,288 --> 00:52:38,188
I'm glad you're here.

465
00:52:38,257 --> 00:52:41,192
I bring in more than enough stuff
for two.

466
00:52:42,628 --> 00:52:44,152
Look.

467
00:52:46,165 --> 00:52:48,565
You see, I'm a treasure hunter.

468
00:52:50,302 --> 00:52:52,395
The city's history is here.

469
00:52:52,471 --> 00:52:54,962
Cast into the sea
and forgotten forever.

470
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:58,408
- L see.
- I'm here, cataloguing, dating.

471
00:52:58,477 --> 00:53:01,071
Wait. That's the land shark's safe.

472
00:53:01,147 --> 00:53:04,378
Oh, yes.
Yes, l brought it in yesterday.

473
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:06,384
And this is Vito Nine Fingers.

474
00:53:06,452 --> 00:53:08,818
Everyone thought he ran away
with his money.

475
00:53:08,888 --> 00:53:12,085
They're wrong.
What are you doing?

476
00:53:12,158 --> 00:53:14,991
I stole them.
I'm taking back what's mine.

477
00:53:15,061 --> 00:53:17,621
Don't go back up there.

478
00:53:17,696 --> 00:53:20,062
It's dangerous!

479
00:53:20,132 --> 00:53:22,566
You're a kid. Stay with me.

480
00:53:24,503 --> 00:53:27,666
Well, thanks for everything,
but I've got to go.

481
00:53:31,911 --> 00:53:33,503
Not that way.

482
00:53:35,848 --> 00:53:38,408
- The children.
- What about them? What do you know?

483
00:53:38,484 --> 00:53:42,284
He takes them.
The devil takes them away...

484
00:53:42,354 --> 00:53:43,946
in his boat.

485
00:53:45,357 --> 00:53:47,257
He takes them to hell.

486
00:53:47,326 --> 00:53:50,523
- What hell?
- The Tattooed Man, he knows where.

487
00:53:52,164 --> 00:53:54,632
The map.

488
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:58,295
The map of the minefield
is tattooed on his body.

489
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,603
It's all my fault.

490
00:54:03,609 --> 00:54:05,770
This man's a proper nut case.

491
00:54:19,291 --> 00:54:21,782
Holy cow, it's little brother again.

492
00:54:24,964 --> 00:54:26,556
Miette.

493
00:54:31,837 --> 00:54:34,101
Take care of him. He's hopeless.

494
00:54:35,541 --> 00:54:37,099
Sure.

495
00:54:39,912 --> 00:54:41,846
What's the trouble, handsome?

496
00:54:43,516 --> 00:54:45,950
There's no reason to be depressed.

497
00:55:11,544 --> 00:55:13,478
- What?
- The girl...

498
00:55:13,546 --> 00:55:18,040
Yes. The girl drowned.
I wasn't going to resuscitate her.

499
00:55:18,117 --> 00:55:21,109
- You should be twice as happy.
- Why are you sniffing?

500
00:55:21,187 --> 00:55:24,281
Why l sniff? So what?
I caught a cold at the pier.

501
00:55:24,356 --> 00:55:27,291
- Get ready in half an hour.
- In a half hour?

502
00:56:03,395 --> 00:56:07,024
Cyclops truck kidnap little brother.

503
00:56:07,099 --> 00:56:08,999
Kidnap Denree.

504
00:56:13,205 --> 00:56:15,833
Very funny.
What are you doing here?

505
00:56:15,908 --> 00:56:18,741
Well, smarty, it wasn't nice
of you to disappear.

506
00:56:18,811 --> 00:56:21,871
I'm sorry, but incredible things
happened to One and me.

507
00:56:21,947 --> 00:56:23,380
No kidding?

508
00:56:23,449 --> 00:56:25,314
The Cyclops
are stealing the chiIdren.

509
00:56:25,384 --> 00:56:29,718
Yeah? And if you want to know,
that doesn't seem to bother Mr. One.

510
00:56:29,788 --> 00:56:31,380
He's picking up girls.

511
00:56:32,324 --> 00:56:34,315
- Who says so?
- Pipo saw him.

512
00:56:34,393 --> 00:56:37,123
- That night.
- In the bar.

513
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,427
You're feeling
a lot better already.

514
00:56:44,937 --> 00:56:48,964
You can handle your liquor,
a strong man like you.

515
00:56:49,041 --> 00:56:51,874
That body. Hard as a rock.

516
00:56:51,944 --> 00:56:54,344
May l touch you?

517
00:56:54,413 --> 00:56:56,347
Oh, wow!

518
00:56:58,017 --> 00:57:00,178
Pretty nice.

519
00:57:00,252 --> 00:57:03,949
I don't like to brag.
But they haven't failed me yet.

520
00:57:11,797 --> 00:57:14,061
My little angel.

521
00:57:20,339 --> 00:57:24,241
Little angel.
Life's a real bitch.

522
00:57:26,312 --> 00:57:28,246
Feel better?

523
00:57:29,415 --> 00:57:31,349
You're not cold?

524
00:57:31,417 --> 00:57:35,547
You kidding?
You're a real radiator.

525
00:57:38,424 --> 00:57:40,016
Radiator.

526
00:57:46,965 --> 00:57:49,092
You should be ashamed
of yourself!

527
00:57:52,037 --> 00:57:54,096
Of course Miette!
You expecting Santa Claus?

528
00:57:54,173 --> 00:57:57,438
When you're through being ridiculous,
maybe we can talk.

529
00:57:57,509 --> 00:58:00,774
Oh, well, there's no problem.
I'll leave you.

530
00:58:00,846 --> 00:58:03,110
See you later, Mr. One.

531
00:58:03,182 --> 00:58:05,650
I know where your brother is.

532
00:58:17,329 --> 00:58:19,661
Why. You're absolutely smashed.

533
00:58:25,104 --> 00:58:27,129
It's really you.

534
00:58:27,206 --> 00:58:30,175
- But how did you manage to...
- You won't believe me.

535
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:33,269
Tell me about it.

536
00:58:33,345 --> 00:58:36,508
- No, l have to take him back.
- He's too heavy.

537
00:58:36,582 --> 00:58:41,315
See what state he's in? You won't
be able to carry him all alone.

538
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:47,625
- Maybe you can help me.
- Me?

539
00:58:47,693 --> 00:58:49,627
Yes, but for real this time.

540
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:57,234
I'm embarrassed.

541
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:01,662
You know l didn't
do it for money.

542
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:03,674
I didn't betray you.

543
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:16,149
What's she doing?

544
00:59:17,823 --> 00:59:21,122
Quick. Run! Go on. Run!

545
00:59:21,193 --> 00:59:23,627
They think you drowned.
Let them go on believing it.

546
00:59:32,404 --> 00:59:34,338
We have to do something.

547
01:00:00,165 --> 01:00:02,099
Lower him!

548
01:00:13,245 --> 01:00:15,770
Get him! Careful!

549
01:00:29,094 --> 01:00:30,721
Great!

550
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,697
- A job well done.
- Trapped like a big, slobbering fish.

551
01:00:38,770 --> 01:00:41,034
What's the matter?
What did he do to you?

552
01:00:41,106 --> 01:00:43,768
- What did he do to you?
- You're inseparable.

553
01:00:43,842 --> 01:00:45,867
- You must be in love.
- Think you're funny?

554
01:00:45,944 --> 01:00:48,879
He's a grown-up,
and you know it.

555
01:00:48,947 --> 01:00:51,415
He may be big.
But he's not grown up.

556
01:00:51,483 --> 01:00:54,043
And maybe you're not
so little either.

557
01:00:54,119 --> 01:00:56,485
- Or you. Or you.
- L am.

558
01:01:03,395 --> 01:01:05,329
Okay, we get the message.

559
01:01:06,532 --> 01:01:08,625
- See ta.
- Bye, Miette.

560
01:01:14,406 --> 01:01:17,000
You'd better get going.
It'll soon get dark.

561
01:02:32,884 --> 01:02:34,408
One?

562
01:02:35,821 --> 01:02:37,311
You asleep?

563
01:02:44,997 --> 01:02:47,397
What did you do before?

564
01:02:53,538 --> 01:02:55,472
One sailor.

565
01:02:56,742 --> 01:02:58,676
Harpooned whales.

566
01:03:03,949 --> 01:03:05,883
One night...

567
01:03:07,653 --> 01:03:09,587
One hear whales singing.

568
01:03:11,523 --> 01:03:13,115
After...

569
01:03:16,028 --> 01:03:18,690
always the target l miss.

570
01:03:22,901 --> 01:03:25,096
One loses job.

571
01:03:38,483 --> 01:03:40,451
What's it like to have
a little brother?

572
01:03:44,122 --> 01:03:46,113
Keeps you...

573
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:49,852
running.

574
01:03:52,731 --> 01:03:56,428
Well, he can't complain
he's got nobody to worry about him.

575
01:04:07,412 --> 01:04:09,972
Denree... little brother.

576
01:04:11,149 --> 01:04:14,676
Miette... little sister.

577
01:04:39,644 --> 01:04:41,578
What are you doing?

578
01:04:46,118 --> 01:04:47,847
Radiator.

579
01:08:24,669 --> 01:08:26,830
Okay, Miette?

580
01:08:26,905 --> 01:08:29,430
You had bad dream?

581
01:08:29,507 --> 01:08:31,441
I saw that woman again.

582
01:08:32,777 --> 01:08:35,803
You know, who steals children.

583
01:08:37,349 --> 01:08:40,648
There were huge balls
in the port...

584
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:42,653
full of spikes.

585
01:08:44,389 --> 01:08:46,118
Mines?

586
01:08:46,191 --> 01:08:50,457
The Tattooed Man
knows where they've taken them.

587
01:08:50,528 --> 01:08:55,329
The map of the minefield
is tattooed on his body.

588
01:08:58,236 --> 01:09:01,034
You were a sailor.
You should know about tattoos.

589
01:09:36,741 --> 01:09:38,766
Big strong guy. Kinda stupid.

590
01:09:38,843 --> 01:09:40,777
Now that rings a bell...
With red hair.

591
01:09:40,845 --> 01:09:43,609
- And hands like a baboon.
- He was supposed to deliver him.

592
01:09:43,681 --> 01:09:46,411
We sent him the trumpet.
He brought it back empty.

593
01:09:46,484 --> 01:09:50,011
- Nothing!
- But he took my sight, l swear!

594
01:09:50,088 --> 01:09:51,578
Shut up!

595
01:09:53,925 --> 01:09:57,588
- The beacons. Don't hurt them.
- Would we do that?

596
01:09:57,662 --> 01:10:00,130
On the contrary. Finish him.

597
01:10:13,178 --> 01:10:16,079
Those sluts.
Always naggin' at me.

598
01:10:52,951 --> 01:10:54,885
Boss?

599
01:10:54,953 --> 01:10:59,049
- The boy ate your dinner.
- It doesn't matter.

600
01:10:59,124 --> 01:11:02,821
You were hungry, no doubt,
my angel. Come closer.

601
01:11:07,432 --> 01:11:11,869
No violence. Mishinka. After all,
this young man is our guest.

602
01:11:13,138 --> 01:11:16,198
The merciless burden
of solitude.

603
01:11:16,274 --> 01:11:20,404
And no one... no one is spared.

604
01:11:20,478 --> 01:11:23,606
Not even great minds.
And that shows...

605
01:11:23,681 --> 01:11:26,616
just how much
l appreciate a visit...

606
01:11:26,684 --> 01:11:29,983
that's as spontaneous as yours.

607
01:11:31,289 --> 01:11:35,248
I'm glad l have
no ears to hear such nonsense.

608
01:11:39,531 --> 01:11:42,261
It's getting rather late
for Irvin.

609
01:11:42,333 --> 01:11:44,927
He becomes so tired.

610
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:51,274
I'm sorry. Uncle Irvin.

611
01:11:57,115 --> 01:11:58,980
Tell me...

612
01:11:59,050 --> 01:12:01,610
are you susceptible
to the influence...

613
01:12:01,686 --> 01:12:04,314
of the fuIl moon?

614
01:12:06,157 --> 01:12:08,591
And to the werewolf?

615
01:12:21,239 --> 01:12:24,402
You're only sensitive
to your nutritive urges.

616
01:12:24,475 --> 01:12:28,275
You're not at all
terrified of me.

617
01:12:28,346 --> 01:12:31,975
You and l were
made for each other.

618
01:12:32,050 --> 01:12:35,349
You are the little boy
that l need.

619
01:12:37,288 --> 01:12:39,779
Let everyone know.

620
01:12:42,493 --> 01:12:46,054
There. Tattoo artist there.

621
01:12:46,130 --> 01:12:48,257
Fifteenth one we've seen.

622
01:12:48,333 --> 01:12:52,633
Hey, Cro-Magnon. Slow down!
I'm pooped.

623
01:12:52,704 --> 01:12:56,105
For every step you take,
l take three.

624
01:13:30,708 --> 01:13:32,539
Tell me...

625
01:13:34,412 --> 01:13:37,677
after you've found your
little brother. What'll you do?

626
01:13:41,352 --> 01:13:42,876
Don't know.

627
01:13:44,222 --> 01:13:46,747
Find work.

628
01:13:46,824 --> 01:13:48,416
House.

629
01:13:50,028 --> 01:13:51,586
One day...

630
01:13:52,664 --> 01:13:55,758
take wife, maybe.

631
01:14:00,672 --> 01:14:02,606
Well. What kind of wife?

632
01:14:06,678 --> 01:14:09,272
No hurry to choose.

633
01:14:10,315 --> 01:14:13,216
Need time to find
shoes One's size.

634
01:14:53,157 --> 01:14:55,591
"Miette for life."

635
01:15:03,167 --> 01:15:05,397
Are you sure you don't remember?

636
01:15:05,470 --> 01:15:09,702
He was a sailor who worked the
minefields. You tattooed the map on him.

637
01:15:09,774 --> 01:15:12,868
He will be most honoured
to answer your question.

638
01:15:45,643 --> 01:15:49,135
What on Earth is that, Mama?

639
01:15:49,213 --> 01:15:52,774
It can't be a submarine.
It's going through the mines.

640
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:56,809
It's the Messiah.
The Messiah has come to save us.

641
01:15:58,956 --> 01:16:01,925
The Messiah walked
on top of the water.

642
01:16:19,076 --> 01:16:21,044
Two hands are better than one.

643
01:16:59,417 --> 01:17:01,942
Hello, Miette.

644
01:17:02,019 --> 01:17:04,647
Oh. No!

645
01:17:04,722 --> 01:17:08,988
Don't say you've forgotten us.
Days and nights without news.

646
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:12,860
- We were beginning to worry about you.
- Don't bother.

647
01:17:12,930 --> 01:17:16,627
We're never coming back.
Right, One?

648
01:17:18,636 --> 01:17:20,365
Truer words were never said.

649
01:17:22,073 --> 01:17:24,735
You'd better give us
those jewels. Quick.

650
01:17:31,816 --> 01:17:34,649
Good work. Very good.

651
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:38,348
Now we'll play a little tune
for you in our own way.

652
01:17:38,422 --> 01:17:42,483
A farewell tune. All right?

653
01:18:59,103 --> 01:19:01,094
He's killing her.

654
01:19:34,205 --> 01:19:37,333
Will you keep quiet?
Shut up, l said!

655
01:19:37,408 --> 01:19:39,342
WilI you shut up?

656
01:19:55,292 --> 01:19:57,988
There's been an accident!

657
01:22:31,582 --> 01:22:34,642
The two little brats
got away, Zee.

658
01:22:37,221 --> 01:22:39,917
But it's not over, is it?

659
01:23:24,602 --> 01:23:26,900
They're hiding.

660
01:23:26,971 --> 01:23:31,237
- And why are they hiding?
- Because they don't want to play.

661
01:23:31,308 --> 01:23:33,401
So that's why they hide.

662
01:23:50,861 --> 01:23:53,728
Why, it's you, my little flea.

663
01:23:55,766 --> 01:23:57,859
Tell me where you've been.

664
01:24:10,881 --> 01:24:13,577
How horrible.

665
01:24:40,511 --> 01:24:42,445
What's the Octopus doing?

666
01:24:44,014 --> 01:24:45,948
Scratch.

667
01:24:57,728 --> 01:25:01,960
Go on. Be careful.

668
01:25:15,212 --> 01:25:17,806
- You got stung, you bitch!
- Bitch!

669
01:25:17,881 --> 01:25:19,678
Bitch yourself!

670
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:21,342
Die!

671
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:25,320
Let go! You're hurting me!

672
01:25:25,389 --> 01:25:27,823
Die, you crazy witch!

673
01:25:27,891 --> 01:25:30,724
- Why must you look like me?
- That's not true!

674
01:25:30,794 --> 01:25:34,457
I don't look like you!
It's you who looks like me!

675
01:25:34,531 --> 01:25:37,500
You old hag!
I'm going to kill you!

676
01:25:37,568 --> 01:25:39,866
I'll kill you first!

677
01:25:42,206 --> 01:25:45,369
- I'll tear your nose off!
- Die!

678
01:25:45,442 --> 01:25:48,275
If l die. You die too!

679
01:25:48,345 --> 01:25:51,314
Think you can live forever.
Always better than anyone else.

680
01:25:51,382 --> 01:25:53,543
You ugly old bitch!

681
01:26:42,366 --> 01:26:45,529
Not a migraine tonight.

682
01:26:45,602 --> 01:26:48,628
I want you
in impeccable condition.

683
01:26:48,705 --> 01:26:50,639
Your concern is really touching.

684
01:26:50,707 --> 01:26:53,267
Has the boy put you
into such good spirits?

685
01:26:53,343 --> 01:26:58,178
A perfect specimen
that is totally uninhibited.

686
01:26:59,616 --> 01:27:02,779
Tonight is my last chance.

687
01:27:11,395 --> 01:27:12,953
What is it?

688
01:27:13,030 --> 01:27:15,794
The thing is here, Mama.

689
01:27:15,866 --> 01:27:17,891
In the house.

690
01:27:19,503 --> 01:27:21,437
What do we do now?

691
01:27:23,607 --> 01:27:25,302
Don't you panic!

692
01:27:26,543 --> 01:27:28,636
Are you men? Yes or no?

693
01:27:28,712 --> 01:27:30,646
No.

694
01:27:32,716 --> 01:27:35,810
Well, that's enough!
Inspection and report!

695
01:27:55,472 --> 01:27:57,406
The explosives!

696
01:28:00,511 --> 01:28:02,069
They've disappeared.

697
01:28:58,235 --> 01:29:01,295
It came from there.
There must be a passage.

698
01:29:01,371 --> 01:29:04,169
Too small. Mouse hole.

699
01:29:04,241 --> 01:29:06,175
It's worth a try. I'm off.

700
01:29:26,363 --> 01:29:29,093
We're really starting
to get attached.

701
01:29:41,044 --> 01:29:43,808
Concentrate on my voice, Krank.

702
01:29:45,649 --> 01:29:48,550
You're sinking into sleep.

703
01:29:48,619 --> 01:29:51,110
You're falling into a void.

704
01:29:51,188 --> 01:29:53,122
Always deeper.

705
01:29:54,858 --> 01:29:57,827
Together, we shall open a door.

706
01:31:57,748 --> 01:31:59,943
Please don't hurt me.

707
01:32:00,951 --> 01:32:03,112
Don't hurt me.

708
01:32:42,559 --> 01:32:44,493
Good-bye. Grasshopper.

709
01:32:48,598 --> 01:32:52,500
- You, Professor.
- There's no more professor, Martha.

710
01:32:52,569 --> 01:32:55,197
Just a terrible mistake.
It must be erased.

711
01:32:56,373 --> 01:32:58,568
Say, l recognize you.

712
01:32:58,642 --> 01:33:01,475
So, little crayfish, huh?

713
01:33:01,545 --> 01:33:04,013
You fell into
a strange net. Huh?

714
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:05,513
Run.

715
01:33:05,582 --> 01:33:07,880
Run before it's too late.

716
01:33:09,986 --> 01:33:13,353
- Does it hurt?
- Yes. I'm allergic to steel.

717
01:33:13,423 --> 01:33:16,449
It's nothing. He'll erase everything.
Like a mistake, you see.

718
01:33:16,526 --> 01:33:18,619
He explained it to me.
You'll feel better after.

719
01:33:18,695 --> 01:33:21,391
Yes. He really knows.

720
01:33:21,465 --> 01:33:24,366
- He's the original.
- What are you doing?

721
01:33:32,108 --> 01:33:33,871
- L found him.
- Who?

722
01:33:33,944 --> 01:33:35,275
There.

723
01:33:35,345 --> 01:33:37,575
- The original.
- The original?

724
01:33:37,647 --> 01:33:39,808
- Quite a shock, no?
- The original.

725
01:33:39,883 --> 01:33:42,044
That's the original.

726
01:33:42,118 --> 01:33:46,111
But I'm the original. It's me!

727
01:33:46,189 --> 01:33:48,089
- No, I'm the original.
- Smell that.

728
01:33:48,158 --> 01:33:50,888
33% sodium nitrate,
20 glycerine carbonate and S02.

729
01:33:54,498 --> 01:33:58,434
Very strange. You remind me
of someone. All of you.

730
01:33:58,502 --> 01:34:00,800
Well. Come on.

731
01:34:00,871 --> 01:34:04,466
- Back to work, huh?
- Hey! And the kids?

732
01:34:05,809 --> 01:34:08,937
- You've forgotten?
- Of course! The little children.

733
01:34:10,780 --> 01:34:14,147
I came for them.
I even brought them this.

734
01:34:16,453 --> 01:34:18,284
And this.

735
01:34:21,558 --> 01:34:24,459
Give them back to them, huh?

736
01:34:24,528 --> 01:34:26,587
Come on! Let's go!

737
01:34:26,663 --> 01:34:29,131
Please, help me!
Which is the way out?

738
01:34:29,199 --> 01:34:30,632
Miss?

739
01:34:32,302 --> 01:34:33,428
Miss?

740
01:34:33,503 --> 01:34:35,698
The passage there.

741
01:34:37,707 --> 01:34:40,608
Take the key. Here.

742
01:34:40,677 --> 01:34:43,669
But don't hurt him.

743
01:34:46,349 --> 01:34:50,376
Go save the children.

744
01:35:19,683 --> 01:35:24,643
Here you are at last.
I've been waiting so long.

745
01:35:24,721 --> 01:35:27,019
Is someone there?

746
01:35:27,090 --> 01:35:31,390
I'm the one speaking.
In the fish tank.

747
01:35:31,461 --> 01:35:34,555
Come closer. Don't be afraid.

748
01:35:35,966 --> 01:35:38,992
It's you who's speaking, mister?

749
01:35:39,069 --> 01:35:42,334
The mines.
The oil rig in your dream.

750
01:35:42,405 --> 01:35:45,431
Remember? That was my message.

751
01:35:47,010 --> 01:35:49,843
Don't try to trick me,
too, mister.

752
01:35:49,913 --> 01:35:52,905
Get up, little brother.
We have to go.

753
01:35:57,554 --> 01:36:01,115
- Wake up, now.
- Oh. No! You'll kill him!

754
01:36:02,792 --> 01:36:05,625
He's under a spell.

755
01:36:05,695 --> 01:36:07,686
There's only one way.

756
01:36:07,764 --> 01:36:10,858
Go find the child where he is...

757
01:36:10,934 --> 01:36:12,697
In the clutches of evil.

758
01:36:14,270 --> 01:36:16,204
Inside the dream.

759
01:36:25,448 --> 01:36:27,382
Look, no hands!

760
01:36:30,186 --> 01:36:32,120
I don't believe this.

761
01:36:33,790 --> 01:36:36,350
What am l doing here?

762
01:36:36,426 --> 01:36:40,123
Don't worry.
Everything will be all right.

763
01:36:42,365 --> 01:36:46,199
If you say so. Mister.
It's funny.

764
01:36:46,269 --> 01:36:48,203
I don't even know
the little brother.

765
01:36:48,271 --> 01:36:50,569
But l know you.

766
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:55,236
The little brother
could have been yours.

767
01:36:55,311 --> 01:36:58,678
Don't be afraid. Just relax.

768
01:36:58,748 --> 01:37:03,811
Now. Close your eyes.
Listen to my voice...

769
01:37:03,887 --> 01:37:05,821
and sleep.

770
01:38:00,210 --> 01:38:02,576
Be brave. Little girl.

771
01:38:34,978 --> 01:38:39,347
Who are you?
Why are you in my dream?

772
01:38:42,285 --> 01:38:46,449
- Why is it his dream?
- Because he's not afraid of me.

773
01:38:46,523 --> 01:38:48,855
Please let me take his place.

774
01:38:48,925 --> 01:38:51,792
What would you get in exchange?

775
01:38:52,929 --> 01:38:54,863
A brother.

776
01:38:58,268 --> 01:39:02,295
If l take his place, maybe
I'll see his big brother again.

777
01:39:04,340 --> 01:39:07,400
You are trying
to trap me, aren't you?

778
01:39:07,477 --> 01:39:10,105
You don't risk very much.

779
01:39:12,448 --> 01:39:14,382
So be it.

780
01:39:33,203 --> 01:39:35,671
Well, my chickadee, huh?

781
01:39:35,738 --> 01:39:38,571
Sometimes it's better to land
in the muck, huh?

782
01:39:40,243 --> 01:39:42,768
Hey, you'd better
get out of this place.

783
01:39:42,846 --> 01:39:44,336
It's going sky-high!

784
01:43:00,843 --> 01:43:03,004
I had a weird dream.

785
01:43:07,483 --> 01:43:11,078
I was very, very old.

786
01:43:12,555 --> 01:43:14,682
And you were dead.

787
01:43:17,894 --> 01:43:22,092
The void equals infinity!

788
01:44:04,574 --> 01:44:06,303
Oh, no, Uncle!

789
01:44:29,765 --> 01:44:32,632
Heave, ho!

790
01:44:42,078 --> 01:44:45,275
Row faster, guys!
It's following us!

791
01:44:45,348 --> 01:44:49,876
What do you mean, following us?
Untie the bowlines, idiots.

792
01:45:22,752 --> 01:45:24,686
Come back!

793
01:45:26,255 --> 01:45:29,520
It's me! Your creator!

794
01:45:32,195 --> 01:45:34,755
I made you! L gave you life!

795
01:45:34,830 --> 01:45:38,231
Irvin! You hear me?

796
01:45:38,301 --> 01:52:30,037
I order you to come back!
