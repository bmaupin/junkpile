1
00:00:18,527 --> 00:00:21,166
<i>1815, a terrible year.</i>

2
00:00:23,247 --> 00:00:27,206
<i>Waterloo cut short</i>
<i>the adventure of Napoleon.</i>

3
00:00:28,207 --> 00:00:31,517
<i>In Paris,</i>
<i>Louis 18th took the throne.</i>

4
00:00:31,687 --> 00:00:34,440
<i>The nobles</i>
<i>who had fled the Revolution</i>

5
00:00:34,607 --> 00:00:37,804
<i>returned in triumph</i>
<i>to a broken France.</i>

6
00:00:39,007 --> 00:00:42,602
<i>I was a soldier</i>
<i>in those dark, arrogant days</i>

7
00:00:42,767 --> 00:00:44,962
<i>that brought hardship to all.</i>

8
00:00:45,527 --> 00:00:48,200
<i>As a physician,</i>
<i>I saw all kinds of suffering</i>

9
00:00:48,367 --> 00:00:50,119
<i>and many kinds of courage</i>

10
00:00:50,807 --> 00:00:54,766
<i>but I met no finer,</i>
<i>more upstanding man</i>

11
00:00:54,927 --> 00:00:58,158
<i>than a simple peasant boy,</i>

12
00:00:58,647 --> 00:01:01,115
<i>a poor, low-bred "croquant".</i>

13
00:01:01,847 --> 00:01:05,476
<i>I know he would not want my praise</i>

14
00:01:05,967 --> 00:01:08,162
<i>but how can I, an old man,</i>

15
00:01:08,327 --> 00:01:10,443
<i>tell a boy that I admire him?</i>

16
00:01:11,007 --> 00:01:14,363
<i>Maybe simply by telling his story.</i>

17
00:02:05,367 --> 00:02:06,846
Gawd, what a start!

18
00:03:17,527 --> 00:03:18,482
Round up the dogs!

19
00:03:20,807 --> 00:03:21,842
Sir!

20
00:03:24,767 --> 00:03:26,917
Round them up
or we'll lose the stag!

21
00:03:27,087 --> 00:03:28,759
Calm down, Mr. Prosecutor.

22
00:03:29,327 --> 00:03:32,080
I know that dog.
It's a poacher's cur.

23
00:03:32,247 --> 00:03:34,317
It deserves to be shot like a wolf.

24
00:03:38,647 --> 00:03:40,683
They've lost the stag.

25
00:03:42,887 --> 00:03:44,525
So they'll hunt a man.

26
00:03:46,887 --> 00:03:48,366
Again! Come on!

27
00:03:48,527 --> 00:03:50,404
Come on, hit!

28
00:03:55,327 --> 00:03:58,160
Legs! Hands together!

29
00:03:58,367 --> 00:03:59,482
Good, Jacquou!

30
00:03:59,887 --> 00:04:00,842
Watch your legs.

31
00:04:01,327 --> 00:04:02,885
Look up. Be bold!

32
00:04:03,047 --> 00:04:05,322
And keep hitting!

33
00:04:36,287 --> 00:04:37,322
Look who's here!

34
00:04:37,927 --> 00:04:39,155
My dog!

35
00:04:40,967 --> 00:04:42,036
Come here, boy!

36
00:04:42,767 --> 00:04:43,722
Good dog.

37
00:04:43,887 --> 00:04:45,240
He must have escaped.

38
00:04:45,767 --> 00:04:47,519
His paws are bleeding.

39
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,200
Rub fat on them.

40
00:04:51,927 --> 00:04:54,236
How did you get here?

41
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,999
Dirty dog! Keep off my apron.

42
00:04:58,367 --> 00:04:59,004
Come here!

43
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:21,725
The dog has to go.

44
00:05:22,607 --> 00:05:25,360
He'll only bring us trouble
from the steward.

45
00:05:25,527 --> 00:05:27,882
The trouble is, it's you he wants.

46
00:05:28,207 --> 00:05:30,277
Always poking his mustache in here.

47
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:35,201
I can handle a mustache.

48
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:36,595
I'm afraid for you.

49
00:05:37,047 --> 00:05:38,924
I'm an innocent, free man.

50
00:05:39,367 --> 00:05:40,846
You should cut those braids.

51
00:05:47,487 --> 00:05:48,442
Good dog.

52
00:06:56,727 --> 00:06:57,762
Mama?

53
00:07:06,687 --> 00:07:09,201
It's only skin deep.

54
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:13,565
All you need is a bandage.

55
00:07:15,927 --> 00:07:17,280
Keep watch outside.

56
00:07:17,447 --> 00:07:19,165
You see anything, don't shout.

57
00:07:38,727 --> 00:07:40,319
Marti, you have to go.

58
00:07:41,287 --> 00:07:42,766
Hide in the forest.

59
00:07:44,447 --> 00:07:46,756
I'm not leaving you.
Those swine shot you.

60
00:07:47,407 --> 00:07:48,362
I'll cope.

61
00:07:48,847 --> 00:07:50,075
They'll make you pay.

62
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:52,478
The boy will pay too if you stay.

63
00:08:26,007 --> 00:08:27,759
Papa, wait for me!

64
00:08:27,927 --> 00:08:30,395
Stay here. You'll get in my way.

65
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:35,084
Be brave. Take care of yourself
and your mother.

66
00:08:36,407 --> 00:08:37,522
Stop him!

67
00:08:39,647 --> 00:08:40,443
Shoot him!

68
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:49,082
Cretins!

69
00:09:00,167 --> 00:09:01,395
Beat it!

70
00:09:05,567 --> 00:09:06,363
Mr. Prosecutor.

71
00:09:06,527 --> 00:09:08,245
What's all this?

72
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:16,958
Let's see.

73
00:09:18,647 --> 00:09:21,161
An edifying sight!

74
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,318
No venison, just dog food.

75
00:09:23,847 --> 00:09:26,361
They lost the stag but killed a pig!

76
00:09:27,087 --> 00:09:28,406
What a dirty boy!

77
00:09:31,007 --> 00:09:32,235
Don't you want my flower?

78
00:09:37,207 --> 00:09:39,482
What black eyes he has!

79
00:09:39,887 --> 00:09:41,525
Tasteless little runt.

80
00:09:43,087 --> 00:09:44,361
Let me see my mother!

81
00:09:44,607 --> 00:09:45,722
Shove off!

82
00:09:47,127 --> 00:09:48,560
It's the son.

83
00:10:04,087 --> 00:10:08,000
Sir Count, it seems
your steward botched the job.

84
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:10,886
Shot the dog, hit the wife.
Husband killed him.

85
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:13,398
A fatal brawl of oafs.

86
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,806
Dolt!

87
00:10:19,607 --> 00:10:21,643
The killer is one of your tenants.

88
00:10:21,807 --> 00:10:24,640
If he acted from jealousy,
that would make it murder

89
00:10:24,807 --> 00:10:26,479
in the first degree.

90
00:10:26,647 --> 00:10:28,603
The victim was a known philanderer.

91
00:10:29,727 --> 00:10:31,957
The old goat! Can you imagine?

92
00:10:33,287 --> 00:10:36,643
Since we're on your land,
which charge should I pursue?

93
00:10:36,807 --> 00:10:38,525
Father, there's the horn.

94
00:10:38,887 --> 00:10:40,525
They've found the stag again

95
00:10:40,847 --> 00:10:41,996
and I'm hungry.

96
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:43,759
He had these hidden.

97
00:10:44,127 --> 00:10:45,401
A Legion medal and...

98
00:10:45,807 --> 00:10:47,206
a colonel's commission.

99
00:10:47,367 --> 00:10:49,119
Read the date and place.

100
00:10:49,287 --> 00:10:52,802
June 18th, 1815.
I'll be damned! Two months ago!

101
00:10:53,247 --> 00:10:55,681
He was commissioned
on the field of Waterloo

102
00:10:56,727 --> 00:10:58,160
by Napoleon...

103
00:10:58,327 --> 00:11:02,115
I mean
the usurper Bonaparte himself.

104
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:05,680
Take him to the castle.

105
00:11:06,807 --> 00:11:09,924
Thank you
for solving the case so fast.

106
00:11:10,687 --> 00:11:13,247
Enough time wasted. To horse!

107
00:11:13,567 --> 00:11:16,604
So it was jealousy? We'll catch him!

108
00:11:16,767 --> 00:11:17,722
I'll see to it.

109
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:21,038
Let's not detain
your lovely daughters any longer.

110
00:11:21,207 --> 00:11:22,526
After you, ladies.

111
00:11:33,207 --> 00:11:34,765
They'll arrest Papa.

112
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:37,680
Have faith.
They haven't caught him yet.

113
00:11:38,007 --> 00:11:41,556
Your father has many friends
and God will protect him.

114
00:11:42,807 --> 00:11:44,160
Lie down.

115
00:11:46,727 --> 00:11:49,241
Lie still. Leave everything to me.

116
00:11:49,407 --> 00:11:52,399
Don't worry.
My heartbeat's just a little fast.

117
00:11:55,567 --> 00:11:56,363
Lie still.

118
00:11:56,527 --> 00:12:00,202
You're right. He's safe.
He knows the forest inside out.

119
00:12:00,567 --> 00:12:02,637
I'll bring him some ammunition.

120
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:04,286
Nothing can happen to him.

121
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:54,841
Oh, it's you.

122
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:09,646
For your dad.

123
00:13:09,807 --> 00:13:11,081
But it's the last time.

124
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,879
Stay away. Times are hard.
Watch out in the village.

125
00:13:42,327 --> 00:13:43,043
Voltaire!

126
00:13:44,287 --> 00:13:45,481
Rousseau!

127
00:13:45,647 --> 00:13:47,239
Philosophers!

128
00:13:47,407 --> 00:13:52,640
See how the perverted poison
of valueless ideas

129
00:13:54,127 --> 00:13:56,516
spawned the Revolution!

130
00:13:57,247 --> 00:13:58,475
Their venom

131
00:13:58,807 --> 00:14:01,719
still infects us

132
00:14:01,887 --> 00:14:03,320
through books!

133
00:14:03,967 --> 00:14:06,606
The kingdom must be cleansed

134
00:14:06,767 --> 00:14:08,200
of sickly theories

135
00:14:09,007 --> 00:14:10,918
and usurpers!

136
00:14:11,647 --> 00:14:14,923
May God help us protect the children

137
00:14:15,327 --> 00:14:17,363
from evil influences.

138
00:14:17,847 --> 00:14:19,326
France must be won back!

139
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:21,839
Go, each one of you

140
00:14:22,007 --> 00:14:24,202
and bring the word of God

141
00:14:24,367 --> 00:14:25,925
into your homes!

142
00:14:26,087 --> 00:14:27,805
Kneel, devil's soldier!

143
00:14:28,927 --> 00:14:31,282
His rebel ilk burned down my castle.

144
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,802
Thirty lashes.

145
00:14:43,927 --> 00:14:45,997
You! Come here.

146
00:14:48,607 --> 00:14:51,121
Wanna buy some drawers?

147
00:14:51,487 --> 00:14:52,522
Feel 'em!

148
00:14:52,687 --> 00:14:54,757
For your mother or sweetheart.

149
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:57,717
- I have no money.
- Got any grub?

150
00:14:59,287 --> 00:15:00,766
- What's in there?
- Hands off!

151
00:15:00,927 --> 00:15:03,282
It's goat dung, to make a potion

152
00:15:03,447 --> 00:15:04,846
against hunger.

153
00:15:05,007 --> 00:15:06,406
Gawd help us!

154
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:11,681
What's going on? Who are they?

155
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,357
Jesuits and Ultra-royalists.

156
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,244
They smell bad but hit hard.

157
00:15:18,687 --> 00:15:20,678
C'mon, let's drown our sorrows.

158
00:15:20,847 --> 00:15:22,485
There's free hot wine.

159
00:15:23,767 --> 00:15:25,997
- What's your name?
- Jacquou.

160
00:15:26,287 --> 00:15:27,879
They call me Cockeye.

161
00:15:45,887 --> 00:15:46,842
You look beautiful.

162
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:50,318
I need to look persuasive.

163
00:15:50,807 --> 00:15:53,241
The Count has the power
to call off the police

164
00:15:53,927 --> 00:15:56,043
and the judge will be lenient.

165
00:15:57,727 --> 00:15:59,001
Hurry up.

166
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:03,483
Hurry up!

167
00:16:04,447 --> 00:16:05,436
Coming.

168
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:16,805
Don't be scared.

169
00:16:31,607 --> 00:16:32,835
Sir Count!

170
00:16:36,247 --> 00:16:38,522
I beg your mercy
on this Christmas day.

171
00:16:38,927 --> 00:16:41,282
My husband has been
on the run for months.

172
00:16:42,447 --> 00:16:44,597
I know her.
She's the farmer's wife.

173
00:16:46,207 --> 00:16:49,563
Her husband murdered your steward.

174
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,117
She has plenty of cheek. And breast!

175
00:16:52,927 --> 00:16:55,725
My husband shot your steward
in self-defense.

176
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:59,081
I'm only a peasant
but my word is true.

177
00:16:59,247 --> 00:17:00,646
This is not the time or place.

178
00:17:01,207 --> 00:17:03,675
It's a police matter.

179
00:17:04,727 --> 00:17:06,763
There's a reward
for catching this...

180
00:17:07,207 --> 00:17:09,038
Barti? Varmi?

181
00:17:09,207 --> 00:17:11,880
- I know how to talk to...
- I know how to listen.

182
00:17:12,527 --> 00:17:13,562
Let's share her.

183
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:15,718
You are disturbing my friends

184
00:17:16,367 --> 00:17:17,561
and even my family

185
00:17:18,527 --> 00:17:19,926
but it's too late now

186
00:17:20,647 --> 00:17:22,558
to come begging for favors.

187
00:17:22,887 --> 00:17:24,081
All I want is justice

188
00:17:25,447 --> 00:17:26,800
and a fair trial...

189
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:27,877
Quiet!

190
00:17:30,247 --> 00:17:31,441
Stand up.

191
00:17:32,247 --> 00:17:34,966
Don't try
to mollify or bargain with me.

192
00:17:37,087 --> 00:17:39,282
- What's the reward?
- 20 gold louis.

193
00:17:40,687 --> 00:17:41,517
Double it.

194
00:17:43,007 --> 00:17:44,838
No, make it 100.

195
00:17:45,327 --> 00:17:47,397
100 louis for the Bonapartist rebel!

196
00:17:49,847 --> 00:17:50,882
100 louis!

197
00:17:51,607 --> 00:17:53,518
The price of 100 cows!

198
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:57,795
Satisfied, Madam?
Now justice will be done

199
00:17:57,967 --> 00:17:59,878
even sooner, thanks to you.

200
00:18:00,407 --> 00:18:04,195
Quiet! Or the reward
will be for his corpse.

201
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:06,924
Merry Christmas to you all.

202
00:18:15,487 --> 00:18:16,886
Come, Mama.

203
00:18:20,527 --> 00:18:22,199
We'll get no help from them.

204
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:25,525
Your father must leave at once.

205
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:29,600
He's at the forge in Fanlac
with some friends.

206
00:18:29,767 --> 00:18:31,280
100 louis would buy them all.

207
00:18:32,887 --> 00:18:34,240
What's the matter?

208
00:18:37,127 --> 00:18:37,843
Don't move.

209
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,482
Stay here.

210
00:18:50,807 --> 00:18:51,523
Go away.

211
00:18:53,687 --> 00:18:54,722
Go away!

212
00:18:57,767 --> 00:18:59,041
Come, Jacquou.

213
00:19:06,447 --> 00:19:09,086
I'll go to Fanlac and warn Papa.

214
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,041
Cross-country,
I'll be there by dawn.

215
00:19:14,087 --> 00:19:16,681
Tell him to meet us in Bordeaux.

216
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:06,397
Run, Papa! It's a trap!

217
00:20:07,487 --> 00:20:08,237
Run!

218
00:20:12,967 --> 00:20:15,242
There! By the barn.
They're like flies!

219
00:20:16,847 --> 00:20:17,882
Behind you!

220
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:29,766
Run, Marti!

221
00:20:54,527 --> 00:20:55,642
Don't move!

222
00:20:59,887 --> 00:21:01,002
Go on.

223
00:21:16,487 --> 00:21:18,079
Stop or I'll shoot!

224
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:21,284
Stop!

225
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:29,676
Stop!

226
00:21:37,407 --> 00:21:38,886
Two men, follow me!

227
00:21:53,967 --> 00:21:55,002
It's me you want?

228
00:21:56,487 --> 00:21:59,684
Let my men go. Tell yours to stop.

229
00:22:01,927 --> 00:22:02,837
You can't...

230
00:22:03,007 --> 00:22:05,202
Stop! In the name of the King,

231
00:22:05,567 --> 00:22:06,716
cease firing!

232
00:22:07,887 --> 00:22:09,320
Cease firing!

233
00:23:08,927 --> 00:23:10,599
They caught him.

234
00:23:17,367 --> 00:23:18,641
Calm down.

235
00:23:20,127 --> 00:23:22,516
Calm down, dear.

236
00:23:25,567 --> 00:23:27,364
We must be strong.

237
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,079
Your father will need us.

238
00:23:36,647 --> 00:23:38,524
God can't abandon us.

239
00:24:16,727 --> 00:24:18,160
Wait here.

240
00:24:44,807 --> 00:24:45,876
Hey, you.

241
00:24:46,207 --> 00:24:47,606
What's your name?

242
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:56,358
Is that an owl or a hawk?

243
00:24:57,207 --> 00:24:58,435
You're ignorant!

244
00:24:58,887 --> 00:25:01,526
- It's a pigeon.
- Look who's talking!

245
00:25:05,247 --> 00:25:07,078
Neat work, Tufty!

246
00:25:09,327 --> 00:25:10,077
Stay.

247
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,002
Stay here.

248
00:25:13,007 --> 00:25:15,362
This is a town. You'll get lost.

249
00:25:26,727 --> 00:25:28,524
Excuse me. Marti Ferral's trial?

250
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:33,678
You said Martin Ferral.
Do you know him?

251
00:25:34,727 --> 00:25:35,682
Who are you, Sir?

252
00:25:36,367 --> 00:25:37,402
I'm...

253
00:25:38,447 --> 00:25:40,005
Good Lord, you're his wife.

254
00:25:40,767 --> 00:25:41,722
And you're Jacquou?

255
00:25:43,087 --> 00:25:45,999
I'm the attorney
appointed to defend him.

256
00:25:46,527 --> 00:25:47,676
You've seen him?

257
00:25:48,567 --> 00:25:50,285
- How is he?
- Well.

258
00:25:50,447 --> 00:25:53,007
He's well.
I only saw him for a minute, but...

259
00:25:56,367 --> 00:25:58,801
- I have some money for you.
- Keep it.

260
00:25:59,847 --> 00:26:03,283
His trial's about to start.
The times are against us.

261
00:26:05,527 --> 00:26:07,245
The Ultras want to spread fear

262
00:26:07,407 --> 00:26:10,479
and this court
is packed with Ultras.

263
00:26:10,647 --> 00:26:12,842
Your husband
is everything they hate.

264
00:26:13,367 --> 00:26:15,323
Bold, rebellious, pro-Napoleon.

265
00:26:15,487 --> 00:26:17,921
But there's hope.
I'll ask for a deferment,

266
00:26:18,087 --> 00:26:19,679
plead undue process,

267
00:26:19,847 --> 00:26:22,645
anything to buy time
until the next court sits.

268
00:26:22,807 --> 00:26:25,196
I'll call you as a witness.

269
00:26:25,687 --> 00:26:27,962
Don't worry, I'll shield you.

270
00:26:28,927 --> 00:26:30,519
Try to look plain.

271
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,366
Tuck in your hair,

272
00:26:33,087 --> 00:26:34,805
cover up your chest.

273
00:26:38,487 --> 00:26:39,886
The lady's with me.

274
00:26:43,527 --> 00:26:45,404
Sorry. No children allowed.

275
00:26:47,367 --> 00:26:49,562
But I'll tell him you're here.

276
00:26:53,407 --> 00:26:54,442
Ready?

277
00:26:56,127 --> 00:26:57,276
Is it your first time?

278
00:26:59,447 --> 00:27:00,402
Mine too.

279
00:27:00,567 --> 00:27:01,636
After you.

280
00:27:09,887 --> 00:27:11,115
Me first!

281
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:17,078
Give me a leg up.

282
00:27:17,567 --> 00:27:19,717
Next case!
Martin Ferral, alias Le Croquant.

283
00:27:21,847 --> 00:27:23,519
Bring in the prisoner!

284
00:27:24,447 --> 00:27:26,403
I want to see my father!

285
00:27:26,567 --> 00:27:28,762
- Let me up!
- How much?

286
00:27:29,207 --> 00:27:31,277
- Move!
- Pay up, kid.

287
00:27:31,447 --> 00:27:32,880
No money, no looky.

288
00:27:34,127 --> 00:27:35,685
He's chained up like a mad dog.

289
00:28:07,847 --> 00:28:09,041
Wake up!

290
00:28:09,207 --> 00:28:13,041
It's all over, kid.
Your dad won't bully you no more.

291
00:28:14,447 --> 00:28:15,960
He copped thirty years!

292
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:17,719
Thirty years hard labor!

293
00:28:25,047 --> 00:28:26,924
He's paid. Pull him up.

294
00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:16,079
This is intolerable! Scandalous!

295
00:29:17,327 --> 00:29:18,157
lmpudence!

296
00:29:18,327 --> 00:29:18,964
Silence!

297
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:21,116
Remove the prisoner!

298
00:29:26,007 --> 00:29:27,963
Silence in court!

299
00:29:31,847 --> 00:29:34,407
- I appeal the verdict!
- All in good time.

300
00:29:34,567 --> 00:29:36,000
Clear the court.

301
00:29:43,247 --> 00:29:44,202
Watch your arses!

302
00:29:45,407 --> 00:29:46,886
Here come the thugs!

303
00:29:48,927 --> 00:29:49,996
Come on.

304
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:16,322
Where can we go?
They took our house away.

305
00:30:17,487 --> 00:30:18,681
We'll find a home.

306
00:30:33,567 --> 00:30:35,683
Nobody will take that from us.

307
00:30:50,927 --> 00:30:52,246
I'm worn out.

308
00:30:54,927 --> 00:30:56,645
We'll fix up gutters tomorrow.

309
00:30:57,447 --> 00:30:58,880
I'm ready to drop.

310
00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:04,722
We can't complain.

311
00:31:05,367 --> 00:31:07,403
It's worse
for your father in chains.

312
00:31:21,447 --> 00:31:23,278
Don't forget to say your prayers.

313
00:31:59,007 --> 00:31:59,723
Morning!

314
00:31:59,887 --> 00:32:02,117
- Are you in charge here?
- Only recently.

315
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:04,320
It's the big spring wash.

316
00:32:04,647 --> 00:32:06,922
Can you take my son?

317
00:32:08,487 --> 00:32:12,241
lt'll be a break from farm work
and less far for him to walk.

318
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:14,361
Please.

319
00:32:15,087 --> 00:32:17,282
All right. On one condition.

320
00:32:18,207 --> 00:32:20,038
Don't mention your name.

321
00:32:20,367 --> 00:32:23,120
I'm nursing the Count's
youngest daughter, Galiote.

322
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:25,239
- Agreed?
- Yes.

323
00:32:28,687 --> 00:32:29,836
Come along.

324
00:32:30,807 --> 00:32:31,717
Thank you.

325
00:32:32,327 --> 00:32:34,238
Help carry those baskets.

326
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:10,800
Ten minute break!

327
00:33:22,007 --> 00:33:23,156
Galiote!

328
00:34:10,527 --> 00:34:11,596
Galiote!

329
00:35:51,167 --> 00:35:52,395
I saw what you did.

330
00:35:52,647 --> 00:35:54,046
You were very brave.

331
00:35:54,847 --> 00:35:56,280
This is for you.

332
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,479
I couldn't find a smaller one.

333
00:36:05,047 --> 00:36:06,082
Thanks.

334
00:36:08,887 --> 00:36:10,320
You have a funny voice.

335
00:36:11,807 --> 00:36:13,206
What's your name?

336
00:36:15,287 --> 00:36:16,686
I know!

337
00:36:17,887 --> 00:36:19,161
I know everything!

338
00:36:19,607 --> 00:36:21,199
You're Jacquou!

339
00:36:25,647 --> 00:36:27,922
Shut up and keep moving.

340
00:36:33,407 --> 00:36:36,399
- Mayor, about my son...
- I'll fix it.

341
00:36:43,127 --> 00:36:43,877
There you are!

342
00:36:44,247 --> 00:36:45,600
I have good and bad news.

343
00:36:46,127 --> 00:36:48,277
Good news
from your father's attorney.

344
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:51,682
He obtained a retrial.

345
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:55,322
Bad news, your father's dead.

346
00:36:57,247 --> 00:37:00,364
Shot the first day,
trying to escape.

347
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,076
Some people don't change.

348
00:37:05,127 --> 00:37:06,003
You there!

349
00:37:06,167 --> 00:37:07,725
Watch out for my clothes!

350
00:37:07,887 --> 00:37:08,842
Damn it!

351
00:37:09,007 --> 00:37:11,885
Stop! Stay out of this.

352
00:37:14,007 --> 00:37:16,726
What's he doing here?
A murderer's son!

353
00:37:17,407 --> 00:37:19,921
Would the Count of Nansac
like seeing him

354
00:37:20,087 --> 00:37:21,281
next to his daughter?

355
00:37:22,847 --> 00:37:24,644
- I didn't know.
- Now you do!

356
00:37:27,367 --> 00:37:28,595
Beat it!

357
00:37:32,287 --> 00:37:34,517
Any comments? Speak up.

358
00:37:34,847 --> 00:37:36,166
It'll be your last time.

359
00:37:36,327 --> 00:37:37,316
Lina!

360
00:37:37,847 --> 00:37:39,075
Back to work!

361
00:38:37,567 --> 00:38:38,716
They killed him.

362
00:38:51,247 --> 00:38:52,316
Come!

363
00:39:09,487 --> 00:39:12,399
Swear, my son!
Swear to avenge your father

364
00:39:12,967 --> 00:39:15,435
for as long as you and that thing

365
00:39:15,607 --> 00:39:17,006
are still standing!

366
00:39:17,167 --> 00:39:19,237
Swear to keep your word!

367
00:39:19,767 --> 00:39:24,204
They couldn't break him down
so they killed him!

368
00:39:25,287 --> 00:39:27,198
Let them fear him in death

369
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:29,642
as much as they feared him in life!

370
00:39:33,887 --> 00:39:36,082
Curse you, vile creature!

371
00:39:36,767 --> 00:39:37,802
Stone by stone!

372
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:40,237
One day you will crumble to dust!

373
00:39:43,167 --> 00:39:45,522
Curse you for what you are!

374
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,320
Curse you!

375
00:39:53,647 --> 00:39:54,875
Mama, can you hear me?

376
00:39:55,047 --> 00:39:57,686
Come away or we'll freeze!

377
00:39:59,847 --> 00:40:00,962
I'll take you home.

378
00:40:09,727 --> 00:40:11,763
I'll be right back.

379
00:40:25,087 --> 00:40:26,725
Leave everything to me.

380
00:40:28,287 --> 00:40:29,356
I'm cold.

381
00:40:46,367 --> 00:40:47,482
It's cold!

382
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:08,241
You'll be all right.

383
00:41:11,287 --> 00:41:13,039
Stay, Jacquou.

384
00:41:15,927 --> 00:41:17,326
Don't leave me.

385
00:41:17,487 --> 00:41:19,045
I'll stay with you.

386
00:41:25,007 --> 00:41:26,122
I'm cold.

387
00:41:37,567 --> 00:41:38,761
That's better.

388
00:41:41,647 --> 00:41:42,796
I feel better.

389
00:42:08,047 --> 00:42:09,799
The storm has passed.

390
00:44:38,567 --> 00:44:40,398
Tufty, do your eyes!

391
00:44:41,367 --> 00:44:44,279
Charity, good people!

392
00:44:44,967 --> 00:44:48,277
Charity for a soldier boy
slashed by an English sword.

393
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:52,999
For pity's sake! A crust
for my deaf and dumb brother,

394
00:44:53,647 --> 00:44:56,605
a poor drummer boy
gelded by a Polish sword.

395
00:44:57,687 --> 00:44:59,518
A penny for my brother, please!

396
00:45:05,247 --> 00:45:07,920
No use.
They've all got hearts of stone.

397
00:45:08,087 --> 00:45:11,124
There's no pity, only misery.

398
00:45:11,407 --> 00:45:13,125
I'm sick of eating candles.

399
00:45:14,407 --> 00:45:15,442
They bloat me up.

400
00:45:16,727 --> 00:45:18,046
Got nothing to drink?

401
00:45:20,487 --> 00:45:23,763
Come on.
Let's find a place to sleep.

402
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,878
I'll catch up. I'm tired.

403
00:45:28,647 --> 00:45:29,363
You sure?

404
00:45:32,887 --> 00:45:33,922
Let's go, Cockeye.

405
00:47:06,967 --> 00:47:09,435
Papa, help me.

406
00:47:09,847 --> 00:47:12,839
I've lost my strength.
I want to be with you two.

407
00:47:57,407 --> 00:47:58,965
Strange! He's early.

408
00:48:00,367 --> 00:48:02,323
Don't try to distract me.

409
00:48:02,487 --> 00:48:04,398
Queen takes bishop, mate in five.

410
00:48:06,487 --> 00:48:09,047
I'm doomed so easily?

411
00:48:09,527 --> 00:48:10,596
And by a lady.

412
00:48:11,887 --> 00:48:13,206
You don't say!

413
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,761
Let me see...

414
00:48:15,327 --> 00:48:17,079
I'm going up, Father.

415
00:48:17,967 --> 00:48:19,082
Good night, Sir Knight.

416
00:48:19,567 --> 00:48:22,240
- See you tomorrow.
- Good night, Fantille.

417
00:48:42,647 --> 00:48:43,602
Curate!

418
00:49:05,287 --> 00:49:06,959
Take him indoors, quick.

419
00:49:11,807 --> 00:49:14,082
Rub him with snow,
away from the fire.

420
00:49:14,247 --> 00:49:15,805
I'll get my medical bag!

421
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:28,878
Snow! More snow!

422
00:49:44,647 --> 00:49:46,444
His pulse is fading. Camphor!

423
00:49:47,927 --> 00:49:50,043
Fight, little fellow!

424
00:49:57,727 --> 00:50:00,560
Keep rubbing. I'll look at his foot.

425
00:50:14,007 --> 00:50:15,235
Fantille, hot water!

426
00:50:15,767 --> 00:50:18,406
- Yes, Sir Knight.
- And a big sheet.

427
00:50:19,887 --> 00:50:21,479
I'll try to save his leg.

428
00:50:36,327 --> 00:50:38,636
Now we can see your nice dark eyes.

429
00:50:40,967 --> 00:50:43,720
The Knight says you're much better.

430
00:50:46,527 --> 00:50:47,846
Much better.

431
00:50:49,687 --> 00:50:51,678
Time will do its work, he says.

432
00:50:51,847 --> 00:50:53,246
He's never wrong.

433
00:50:53,407 --> 00:50:56,046
But you must eat.
Build up your strength,

434
00:50:56,207 --> 00:50:58,198
little mystery man.

435
00:51:01,607 --> 00:51:03,086
Eat, dear boy.

436
00:51:04,527 --> 00:51:05,676
I know you can hear.

437
00:51:07,567 --> 00:51:09,285
I know you're not...

438
00:51:10,247 --> 00:51:11,919
Lord, help him.

439
00:51:28,287 --> 00:51:29,959
What's making you twitchy?

440
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:32,801
Nothing, Mama. Can I go for a walk?

441
00:51:33,127 --> 00:51:34,242
You'll miss lunch.

442
00:51:35,007 --> 00:51:36,201
I've got an apple.

443
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:32,080
Come back, Jacquou.

444
00:52:35,767 --> 00:52:37,359
Come back.

445
00:52:56,247 --> 00:52:56,963
Lina?

446
00:53:03,927 --> 00:53:04,882
I'm hungry!

447
00:53:25,607 --> 00:53:27,404
Father!

448
00:53:39,927 --> 00:53:41,076
What's your name?

449
00:53:41,727 --> 00:53:43,877
Mathieu, Sir. I mean Father.

450
00:53:45,687 --> 00:53:46,915
Where are you from?

451
00:53:47,247 --> 00:53:48,566
Bergerac.

452
00:53:51,007 --> 00:53:52,326
You're far from home.

453
00:53:53,687 --> 00:53:55,040
Which way did you come?

454
00:53:56,047 --> 00:53:58,607
Through Auberoche or Sainte-Foy?

455
00:54:00,847 --> 00:54:03,077
- Through Suzardie.
- You can read?

456
00:54:03,687 --> 00:54:05,359
Here, only Protestants can read.

457
00:54:06,527 --> 00:54:08,404
Is this your first time here?

458
00:54:09,727 --> 00:54:10,557
You're lying!

459
00:54:12,407 --> 00:54:14,602
I saw you when they caught
the Bonapartist.

460
00:54:15,167 --> 00:54:17,840
You knelt in the snow
at the edge of the village.

461
00:54:47,207 --> 00:54:48,322
I'm Jacquou Ferral.

462
00:54:48,487 --> 00:54:51,320
My dad died in chains
and the grief killed my mother.

463
00:54:51,687 --> 00:54:53,803
I set fire to the Count's forest.

464
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:56,357
If God exists,
he should have let me die.

465
00:54:56,527 --> 00:54:58,757
He should care for the poor!

466
00:55:10,647 --> 00:55:11,841
May I join you?

467
00:55:22,407 --> 00:55:23,442
Man to man,

468
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:25,886
how do you like this bacon?

469
00:55:26,247 --> 00:55:28,397
Too salty, right?

470
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:31,361
But I can't tell Fantille.
She swears by it.

471
00:55:32,647 --> 00:55:34,160
It's the same with God.

472
00:55:34,967 --> 00:55:37,686
I often think His world is hard
but I keep quiet

473
00:55:38,727 --> 00:55:42,481
because I don't know if it's me
or the world that is faulty.

474
00:56:10,487 --> 00:56:12,045
The smith gave them work.

475
00:56:13,087 --> 00:56:14,236
He's too soft.

476
00:56:15,087 --> 00:56:16,042
Right!

477
00:56:16,567 --> 00:56:19,206
I need a plucky altar boy

478
00:56:19,367 --> 00:56:23,042
to come with me at night to visit
the dying and women in labor,

479
00:56:23,207 --> 00:56:24,925
to chop wood for the poor,

480
00:56:25,767 --> 00:56:28,725
eat what I eat, see life as a gift

481
00:56:28,887 --> 00:56:31,037
and not waste time on self-pity.

482
00:56:31,207 --> 00:56:33,596
It's thankless work.
You'll stay thin.

483
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:36,476
Think about it.

484
00:56:50,207 --> 00:56:51,356
I'll take it.

485
00:58:00,167 --> 00:58:01,122
I know that man.

486
00:58:02,127 --> 00:58:03,480
He scares me.

487
00:58:04,687 --> 00:58:07,247
Don't be scared.
I'm the one he's watching.

488
00:58:10,327 --> 00:58:11,521
Why you?

489
00:58:12,367 --> 00:58:13,766
Because I signed.

490
00:58:15,287 --> 00:58:18,120
During the Revolution,
I recognized the Republic.

491
00:58:18,287 --> 00:58:19,845
Most priests did.

492
00:58:21,127 --> 00:58:22,606
Now we're suspect.

493
00:58:26,887 --> 00:58:29,959
The Count of Nansac dislikes me

494
00:58:30,127 --> 00:58:33,483
and so does his Jesuit chaplain.

495
00:58:34,127 --> 00:58:36,163
Some people see guilt everywhere.

496
00:58:36,647 --> 00:58:39,844
Remember.
Only forgiveness makes us great.

497
00:58:43,527 --> 00:58:45,802
You did well for a beginner.

498
00:58:49,207 --> 00:58:50,435
Now run along.

499
00:58:51,727 --> 00:58:52,955
Be back for supper.

500
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:24,678
I could never leave here.

501
00:59:25,167 --> 00:59:28,716
I feel like I'm part
of every plant and pebble.

502
00:59:31,887 --> 00:59:35,084
Want to see a cave
with a river and bear skulls?

503
00:59:37,807 --> 00:59:39,445
Want to see my trout lake?

504
00:59:42,967 --> 00:59:44,002
My tree house?

505
00:59:44,927 --> 00:59:47,680
Show me the tree
where fairies dance.

506
00:59:48,407 --> 00:59:50,398
There's no such thing, Lina.

507
00:59:50,567 --> 00:59:53,365
There is! Down there by the river.

508
00:59:58,647 --> 00:59:59,636
Boys are so silly!

509
01:00:18,207 --> 01:00:19,845
Wait for me!

510
01:00:22,047 --> 01:00:22,877
Wait!

511
01:01:32,247 --> 01:01:33,396
Is the Curate in?

512
01:01:34,327 --> 01:01:36,397
Give him this from the Bishop.

513
01:02:10,647 --> 01:02:14,083
Go on in, I'll join you.

514
01:02:43,687 --> 01:02:45,359
Bad news, Father?

515
01:02:46,407 --> 01:02:47,726
As usual.

516
01:02:49,447 --> 01:02:50,766
Don't tell Jacquou.

517
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:56,716
Let's eat.

518
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,359
One trouble at a time.

519
01:03:00,327 --> 01:03:01,726
Supper, Jacquou.

520
01:03:06,447 --> 01:03:09,678
Rumor says the King
wants to muzzle the press.

521
01:03:09,847 --> 01:03:12,998
To keep control, the Ultras
want to set us back 100 years.

522
01:03:15,887 --> 01:03:17,286
The King's an Ultra,

523
01:03:17,447 --> 01:03:19,642
all the ministers and laws
are Ultra.

524
01:03:20,367 --> 01:03:22,278
They're in power everywhere.

525
01:03:23,367 --> 01:03:25,323
But they want more.

526
01:03:25,487 --> 01:03:27,318
Every village, every church.

527
01:03:27,687 --> 01:03:30,155
Their arrogance
blinds them completely.

528
01:03:31,287 --> 01:03:33,198
He's having a revolutionary fit!

529
01:03:35,207 --> 01:03:36,845
Don't be a fool. Look at me.

530
01:03:38,487 --> 01:03:40,557
The Ultras are stupid
but not foolish.

531
01:03:41,607 --> 01:03:43,245
The Count of Nansac is an Ultra.

532
01:03:47,647 --> 01:03:48,796
Nansac!

533
01:03:49,567 --> 01:03:53,355
He'll track down anyone
willing or able to lead a revolt...

534
01:03:54,607 --> 01:03:55,676
and eliminate them

535
01:03:56,047 --> 01:03:57,116
one by one.

536
01:03:59,207 --> 01:04:00,959
He's left us alone too long.

537
01:04:01,127 --> 01:04:03,687
He'll come to the village.
He has to.

538
01:04:06,327 --> 01:04:07,396
So please...

539
01:04:07,767 --> 01:04:09,120
be careful, Jacquou.

540
01:04:09,647 --> 01:04:11,239
He's right. Protect yourself.

541
01:04:11,887 --> 01:04:12,956
I'll be careful.

542
01:04:14,287 --> 01:04:17,962
You beat me to it, Knight.
The boy's on the road to forgiveness.

543
01:04:20,087 --> 01:04:21,281
Don't disappoint me.

544
01:04:30,607 --> 01:04:33,644
Go to bed or sit down!
It's no time for dusting.

545
01:04:33,807 --> 01:04:35,365
Thank you, Father.

546
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:48,035
How do you like my soup?

547
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:50,601
Rather rough.

548
01:04:51,287 --> 01:04:53,118
But you get used to it.

549
01:05:23,127 --> 01:05:24,958
Jeanne! Plates!

550
01:05:25,127 --> 01:05:26,526
Bring plates!

551
01:05:26,727 --> 01:05:28,524
Curate, the meat!

552
01:05:29,007 --> 01:05:29,996
Nearly done!

553
01:05:30,167 --> 01:05:31,236
Please!

554
01:05:31,567 --> 01:05:33,125
Stop it.

555
01:05:37,727 --> 01:05:40,321
It's Cockeye.
She's bursting for him!

556
01:05:40,487 --> 01:05:43,240
He's no stunner
but he swells my tits!

557
01:05:46,367 --> 01:05:47,959
Ladies, take my body and dance!

558
01:05:50,287 --> 01:05:51,322
She's all twitchy.

559
01:05:51,847 --> 01:05:54,680
Hold your breath.
I haven't finished!

560
01:05:55,007 --> 01:05:55,962
Make yourself useful.

561
01:05:56,847 --> 01:05:58,075
Put your finger there.

562
01:05:58,647 --> 01:06:00,126
Only my finger?

563
01:06:00,287 --> 01:06:01,720
Hold still, Bertille!

564
01:06:06,847 --> 01:06:09,839
You're as soft as a feather bed.

565
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:13,522
When I get you,
I'll work off 20 pounds!

566
01:06:15,487 --> 01:06:17,478
Can you get wine for the musicians?

567
01:06:22,047 --> 01:06:23,400
The Count's coming.

568
01:06:23,927 --> 01:06:25,883
Why? He never comes here.

569
01:06:26,327 --> 01:06:27,316
Too scared of dung!

570
01:06:27,487 --> 01:06:28,920
And mucking his clothes!

571
01:06:29,087 --> 01:06:31,760
My itchy arse tells me he'll come.

572
01:06:31,927 --> 01:06:34,441
Get a wash!
I'm going to help with the fire.

573
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:48,361
Quiet! Sit down!

574
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,679
Sit down! Quiet!

575
01:06:54,607 --> 01:06:55,722
Tufty?

576
01:06:57,287 --> 01:06:58,561
Will you ask me to dance?

577
01:07:03,327 --> 01:07:05,283
Musicians, please...

578
01:07:06,127 --> 01:07:07,082
Thank you.

579
01:07:07,447 --> 01:07:09,278
As it's my honor to open the dance,

580
01:07:09,447 --> 01:07:11,165
I put on my best suit.

581
01:07:12,287 --> 01:07:13,686
He's out to get married!

582
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:19,843
For our annual dance contest...

583
01:07:20,687 --> 01:07:21,961
The raffle!

584
01:07:22,127 --> 01:07:23,685
Not forgetting the raffle...

585
01:07:24,727 --> 01:07:26,240
and its splendid prize!

586
01:07:29,727 --> 01:07:31,683
To pick the lucky winner,

587
01:07:31,847 --> 01:07:33,485
I need a blameless hand.

588
01:07:36,487 --> 01:07:37,806
No blameless hands?

589
01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:43,286
You, little girl!

590
01:07:44,127 --> 01:07:45,640
Come up here.

591
01:07:48,287 --> 01:07:49,481
Pick a number.

592
01:07:57,447 --> 01:08:00,439
- It's pretty!
- It's pretty and it's 138.

593
01:08:01,007 --> 01:08:02,679
138!

594
01:08:02,967 --> 01:08:05,435
Who has the lucky number?

595
01:08:05,687 --> 01:08:07,564
Who wins the piglet?

596
01:08:27,847 --> 01:08:29,405
I have number 138.

597
01:08:34,207 --> 01:08:35,037
Check it.

598
01:08:39,861 --> 01:08:41,294
138, it is.

599
01:08:42,061 --> 01:08:43,380
What's mine is mine.

600
01:08:49,861 --> 01:08:50,816
Can I have it?

601
01:09:03,981 --> 01:09:05,334
What should I do...

602
01:09:06,501 --> 01:09:08,332
if I'm refused what is mine?

603
01:09:20,141 --> 01:09:22,860
If I give it to you,
will you be happy?

604
01:09:23,341 --> 01:09:24,376
Yes!

605
01:09:25,901 --> 01:09:26,856
Then have it.

606
01:09:29,221 --> 01:09:30,176
Do I get a kiss?

607
01:09:34,581 --> 01:09:37,300
There, now.
It was all a misunderstanding.

608
01:09:46,381 --> 01:09:48,372
Please carry on.

609
01:09:48,541 --> 01:09:50,133
I was about to open the dance.

610
01:09:50,301 --> 01:09:51,370
Excellent idea, Knight.

611
01:09:55,461 --> 01:09:57,850
- Stick close to him.
- If that's an order.

612
01:10:06,261 --> 01:10:08,172
Have you announced the good news?

613
01:10:10,501 --> 01:10:11,695
After the dance.

614
01:10:14,301 --> 01:10:16,861
Chaplain,
what's your stand on dances?

615
01:10:17,021 --> 01:10:18,579
The same as on mushrooms.

616
01:10:19,021 --> 01:10:21,296
Even the best ones are worthless.

617
01:10:22,781 --> 01:10:24,692
No dances, no weddings.

618
01:10:24,861 --> 01:10:26,738
More nunneries, more empty pews.

619
01:10:29,061 --> 01:10:31,336
Splendid!
We're in for a witty evening.

620
01:10:36,821 --> 01:10:38,015
Button your breeches.

621
01:10:38,181 --> 01:10:40,251
Non-contestants, leave the stage.

622
01:10:40,781 --> 01:10:41,850
This way.

623
01:10:42,941 --> 01:10:45,455
Contestants, take the stage.

624
01:10:47,141 --> 01:10:48,290
Hold still.

625
01:10:52,341 --> 01:10:54,457
Get into position.

626
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:57,731
Boys and girls in separate lines,

627
01:10:58,621 --> 01:11:01,135
face to face. Good.

628
01:11:01,741 --> 01:11:03,220
Quiet!

629
01:11:03,381 --> 01:11:06,771
These ladies are the jury.
Their decisions are final.

630
01:11:06,941 --> 01:11:08,454
Count on us, Knight!

631
01:11:08,621 --> 01:11:09,974
Thank you, Fantille.

632
01:11:10,261 --> 01:11:11,740
Musicians, please.

633
01:11:12,141 --> 01:11:14,575
Everybody ready?

634
01:11:14,741 --> 01:11:16,493
Let the dance begin!

635
01:11:30,981 --> 01:11:32,858
- Hello, Lina.
- Hello, Galiote.

636
01:11:33,021 --> 01:11:34,249
May I?

637
01:11:41,101 --> 01:11:42,250
Recognize me?

638
01:11:45,861 --> 01:11:47,931
You saved my life long ago.

639
01:11:53,541 --> 01:11:55,372
Who is this upstart?

640
01:11:56,741 --> 01:11:59,938
You had his father killed in chains.
The grief killed his mother.

641
01:12:02,581 --> 01:12:06,460
How these beasts cling to the past!

642
01:12:07,021 --> 01:12:08,215
Yes, father.

643
01:12:14,861 --> 01:12:16,055
Young lady!

644
01:12:17,541 --> 01:12:20,738
My daughter took your partner.
It's my duty to replace him.

645
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:24,491
Now's your chance
to be queen of the ball.

646
01:12:28,141 --> 01:12:29,290
Round dance!

647
01:12:37,221 --> 01:12:39,451
Form a ring, please.

648
01:12:40,741 --> 01:12:42,174
You're dancing, Count?

649
01:12:42,341 --> 01:12:44,730
Why not?
It's only a clodhopper's minuet.

650
01:12:59,021 --> 01:12:59,897
Music!

651
01:13:21,781 --> 01:13:23,612
Pasquier, slow! Suzanne, clumsy!

652
01:13:23,781 --> 01:13:25,976
Pasquier, out! Suzanne, out!

653
01:13:31,501 --> 01:13:32,650
Green suit,

654
01:13:33,061 --> 01:13:34,096
ungainly!

655
01:13:35,461 --> 01:13:38,339
Green suit! Step down, please.

656
01:13:46,101 --> 01:13:48,217
Mathieu and Jeanne, out.

657
01:13:48,501 --> 01:13:51,220
- The Count dances well.
- He has enough time to!

658
01:13:59,461 --> 01:14:00,291
Lina's down.

659
01:14:01,501 --> 01:14:02,456
Lina fell!

660
01:14:05,741 --> 01:14:06,457
Lina, out.

661
01:14:14,581 --> 01:14:16,299
The Baron is down.

662
01:14:16,461 --> 01:14:19,214
He's already out!

663
01:14:20,981 --> 01:14:22,130
Hands off!

664
01:14:23,661 --> 01:14:25,060
Stop the music!

665
01:14:28,421 --> 01:14:30,412
Foul play. They tripped her.

666
01:14:31,821 --> 01:14:33,015
I was tripped too.

667
01:14:33,421 --> 01:14:35,139
What say the jury?

668
01:14:35,581 --> 01:14:37,537
- I didn't see.
- Me neither.

669
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:40,417
Hard to say.

670
01:14:40,981 --> 01:14:42,380
Caught her skirt?

671
01:14:42,541 --> 01:14:43,860
It can happen.

672
01:14:48,461 --> 01:14:50,019
Well, Fantille?

673
01:14:50,781 --> 01:14:51,657
There's a doubt.

674
01:14:53,221 --> 01:14:54,415
Start again.

675
01:14:54,661 --> 01:14:56,060
Start again!

676
01:14:56,221 --> 01:14:57,574
Have to start again.

677
01:15:00,341 --> 01:15:01,740
Lina! Come.

678
01:15:19,661 --> 01:15:20,332
I'm waiting!

679
01:15:28,901 --> 01:15:30,937
Sir Count, would you mind?

680
01:15:39,141 --> 01:15:42,258
Decidedly, this bumpkin
needs to learn a lesson.

681
01:16:10,341 --> 01:16:11,490
Music!

682
01:17:15,501 --> 01:17:16,820
The Count lost the beat!

683
01:17:17,581 --> 01:17:19,492
The Count must step down.

684
01:17:20,621 --> 01:17:21,815
Enough!

685
01:17:27,701 --> 01:17:29,692
But the contest is a tradition...

686
01:17:30,101 --> 01:17:31,693
Enough, I said!

687
01:17:54,901 --> 01:17:56,220
Can't we go on?

688
01:17:56,581 --> 01:17:58,014
We'll win another day.

689
01:18:05,381 --> 01:18:06,655
Give me your hand.

690
01:18:06,901 --> 01:18:08,619
- There's no music.
- Your hand.

691
01:18:10,701 --> 01:18:12,020
We can't!

692
01:18:13,981 --> 01:18:16,620
Nobody dances like this.
Not in public!

693
01:18:18,541 --> 01:18:20,452
Brace yourself. Hand on my shoulder.

694
01:18:32,141 --> 01:18:35,258
You can't allow this fornication!

695
01:20:05,221 --> 01:20:07,337
I feel like I just discovered you.

696
01:20:57,141 --> 01:20:58,654
Now's the time!

697
01:20:59,541 --> 01:21:01,179
Say the word, we'll cut them up.

698
01:21:02,021 --> 01:21:03,977
The whole county wants him dead!

699
01:21:04,941 --> 01:21:06,738
We're sick of waiting.

700
01:21:09,061 --> 01:21:10,414
I'm waiting, aren't I?

701
01:21:14,541 --> 01:21:15,860
Let them go.

702
01:21:31,941 --> 01:21:33,374
Cockeye! Come here.

703
01:22:15,981 --> 01:22:18,370
My uncle's a cardinal.
I'll fight this!

704
01:22:19,021 --> 01:22:21,774
It's no use.
My successor's already on his way.

705
01:22:22,221 --> 01:22:26,453
You would have to appeal to the Pope
and I'm only a parish priest.

706
01:22:26,821 --> 01:22:28,334
The Count has a long arm.

707
01:22:28,541 --> 01:22:30,099
My time is past.

708
01:22:30,941 --> 01:22:32,215
They can't do this!

709
01:22:32,861 --> 01:22:35,614
Your face is as white
as stale cheese.

710
01:22:36,941 --> 01:22:38,420
They can't do it,

711
01:22:38,581 --> 01:22:40,890
but they do.
We don't control our fate.

712
01:22:42,141 --> 01:22:44,894
You'd fight the Bishop and King
with a sheep hook?

713
01:22:46,781 --> 01:22:48,055
Sit down!

714
01:22:49,181 --> 01:22:51,490
You too, Knight. You look no better.

715
01:22:54,781 --> 01:22:58,694
I have some good pâté
and one of Fantille's pies.

716
01:23:04,461 --> 01:23:05,780
Help yourselves.

717
01:23:06,021 --> 01:23:09,252
I even have
a decent bottle somewhere.

718
01:23:47,221 --> 01:23:48,540
One more minute.

719
01:23:49,061 --> 01:23:50,972
One more minute, Lord.

720
01:23:53,061 --> 01:23:54,494
We'll petition the Bishop

721
01:23:55,461 --> 01:23:57,133
and Rome, if we have to.

722
01:24:08,421 --> 01:24:09,854
My best wine!

723
01:24:12,541 --> 01:24:15,339
If they'd told me at the seminary

724
01:24:15,501 --> 01:24:18,174
that I'd end up with a freethinker
and a Protestant,

725
01:24:18,381 --> 01:24:20,019
I wouldn't have believed it.

726
01:24:20,581 --> 01:24:21,730
We're your friends.

727
01:24:23,061 --> 01:24:24,255
My friends...

728
01:24:26,341 --> 01:24:27,774
fill me a plate.

729
01:24:36,101 --> 01:24:36,851
Curate!

730
01:24:39,021 --> 01:24:40,249
Open his collar!

731
01:24:40,861 --> 01:24:42,772
Give him air. Sit him up!

732
01:24:48,741 --> 01:24:49,856
No need...

733
01:24:51,661 --> 01:24:55,654
Standing up or lying down,
a priest always dies on his knees.

734
01:24:56,741 --> 01:24:59,301
Jacquou, my boy.

735
01:24:59,861 --> 01:25:02,500
Hang up the lantern. Don't forget.

736
01:25:02,661 --> 01:25:05,778
Hang it in the window,
like every night.

737
01:25:07,621 --> 01:25:08,576
You know why?

738
01:25:11,941 --> 01:25:13,135
You shouldn't speak.

739
01:25:13,301 --> 01:25:14,893
I wouldn't if he answered!

740
01:25:15,981 --> 01:25:18,893
To think this rascal
was my altar boy!

741
01:25:20,581 --> 01:25:23,812
I still have enough strength
to kick your behind.

742
01:25:24,261 --> 01:25:28,300
Do we hang up the lantern to give
warmth and light to us alone?

743
01:25:30,021 --> 01:25:31,773
No, it's like a beacon.

744
01:25:32,381 --> 01:25:33,780
Exactly.

745
01:25:34,341 --> 01:25:37,651
It guides the distant traveler.
It gives him hope.

746
01:25:38,021 --> 01:25:41,013
He cannot feel its heat

747
01:25:41,181 --> 01:25:42,739
but it warms his heart

748
01:25:43,061 --> 01:25:44,699
because he knows it's there.

749
01:25:44,861 --> 01:25:46,772
To you, Jacquou, its light

750
01:25:46,941 --> 01:25:49,580
means life, word of honor,

751
01:25:49,981 --> 01:25:51,733
a sense of freedom.

752
01:25:52,021 --> 01:25:54,854
To me, it has only one name,

753
01:25:55,021 --> 01:25:57,171
but that name embraces everything.

754
01:25:59,581 --> 01:26:00,457
I'll stop.

755
01:26:00,621 --> 01:26:03,977
But I won't stop trying to drum
some Christian feeling into you.

756
01:26:06,101 --> 01:26:07,056
Remember,

757
01:26:07,621 --> 01:26:11,136
I've lost
the right to bear the name,

758
01:26:11,941 --> 01:26:13,579
but I am still a priest.

759
01:26:15,021 --> 01:26:18,570
I know. I'm your crown of thorns.

760
01:26:31,301 --> 01:26:32,450
He's dead.

761
01:28:05,581 --> 01:28:06,536
Quick!

762
01:28:08,421 --> 01:28:10,093
Lina's had an accident!

763
01:29:06,981 --> 01:29:07,970
Recognize me?

764
01:29:31,381 --> 01:29:33,099
That'll stop him dancing.

765
01:30:56,701 --> 01:30:59,420
- What's that?
- Jacquou's horn.

766
01:31:09,021 --> 01:31:10,090
Find him!

767
01:31:11,741 --> 01:31:12,856
Go fetch!

768
01:31:54,341 --> 01:31:56,172
They want to search the castle, Sir.

769
01:31:56,621 --> 01:31:58,213
They have a piece of paper.

770
01:32:01,021 --> 01:32:01,737
Police?

771
01:32:02,541 --> 01:32:04,611
In my house, before prayers!
Like vultures!

772
01:32:05,061 --> 01:32:06,414
How dare you?

773
01:32:06,581 --> 01:32:08,537
Sorry, Sir. It's the Knight.

774
01:32:10,661 --> 01:32:12,538
You have some nerve!

775
01:32:13,141 --> 01:32:14,779
I could throw you out.

776
01:32:15,101 --> 01:32:16,693
You can refuse a favor,

777
01:32:16,861 --> 01:32:19,421
but denying a legitimate doubt
looks suspect.

778
01:32:19,581 --> 01:32:20,650
Beware, Knight.

779
01:32:21,221 --> 01:32:22,973
You're risking your honor and wealth

780
01:32:23,661 --> 01:32:26,095
for a backward little peasant.

781
01:32:26,421 --> 01:32:29,094
Little people in revolt
can cause a revolution

782
01:32:29,821 --> 01:32:33,860
but the nobility's downfall
will be caused by nobles like you.

783
01:32:36,981 --> 01:32:38,209
The smaller the dog,

784
01:32:38,541 --> 01:32:39,974
the louder it barks.

785
01:32:41,021 --> 01:32:42,579
Sorry, Sir

786
01:32:42,741 --> 01:32:44,459
but it's standard practice.

787
01:32:44,621 --> 01:32:45,736
- Quite banal.
- Banal!

788
01:32:45,901 --> 01:32:47,414
Just like you!

789
01:32:47,701 --> 01:32:50,056
Petty, small and dull!

790
01:32:50,541 --> 01:32:51,610
Go on, then.

791
01:32:51,781 --> 01:32:54,341
Take him and his trollop
wherever he wants.

792
01:32:54,501 --> 01:32:56,537
But only them. The others, out!

793
01:32:57,661 --> 01:32:58,616
Out, I said!

794
01:33:01,181 --> 01:33:03,376
Make way for the Knight

795
01:33:03,941 --> 01:33:05,090
and his morals.

796
01:33:06,661 --> 01:33:09,221
We'll start with the cellars.

797
01:33:09,581 --> 01:33:10,730
Follow me.

798
01:34:31,501 --> 01:34:34,015
See? The Count has nothing to hide.

799
01:34:34,261 --> 01:34:36,536
Only 32 more rooms to search!

800
01:34:36,941 --> 01:34:38,294
Plus the stables and moat,

801
01:34:38,821 --> 01:34:39,970
the attics...

802
01:34:43,181 --> 01:34:44,739
and the dung heap.

803
01:34:53,781 --> 01:34:54,736
Right!

804
01:34:55,181 --> 01:34:56,330
Let's move on.

805
01:34:59,101 --> 01:35:00,295
Come, Lina.

806
01:40:32,461 --> 01:40:34,770
It can't be!
Everybody thinks you're dead!

807
01:40:34,941 --> 01:40:36,693
Get me out, quick.

808
01:40:37,101 --> 01:40:38,170
Come.

809
01:40:43,381 --> 01:40:44,814
Bye, gorgeous!

810
01:40:58,295 --> 01:40:59,250
Giddup!

811
01:41:49,975 --> 01:41:51,090
Kiss me.

812
01:42:08,295 --> 01:42:10,047
Lina, I'm hungry.

813
01:42:19,895 --> 01:42:21,294
Lina?

814
01:42:23,455 --> 01:42:25,730
Look what I brought...

815
01:42:38,495 --> 01:42:39,928
Stop it, Mario!

816
01:42:45,095 --> 01:42:46,164
What are you doing?

817
01:42:47,295 --> 01:42:48,808
He betrayed me to the Count!

818
01:42:52,495 --> 01:42:53,211
Stop it!

819
01:43:01,295 --> 01:43:04,048
Die, oaf! I'll finish you off.

820
01:43:18,375 --> 01:43:19,967
Don't kill him.

821
01:43:34,015 --> 01:43:35,528
Where the hell were you?

822
01:43:37,895 --> 01:43:39,123
Buried under the castle.

823
01:43:41,295 --> 01:43:42,887
They dared!

824
01:43:44,015 --> 01:43:45,414
We have to strike now.

825
01:43:46,415 --> 01:43:48,724
I know where the guns are
and how to get in.

826
01:43:49,175 --> 01:43:51,484
Surprise and speed are the key.

827
01:43:52,535 --> 01:43:53,570
Look.

828
01:43:54,135 --> 01:43:57,810
Here's the castle.
We attack there, but we get in here.

829
01:43:58,175 --> 01:44:00,006
Do you have to mumble?

830
01:45:21,215 --> 01:45:23,251
Don't push me away.

831
01:45:25,775 --> 01:45:27,367
I've felt cold for a week.

832
01:45:28,215 --> 01:45:30,649
The only cold you know
is a chilly day's hunting.

833
01:45:34,135 --> 01:45:35,966
Go back to your kin, Miss Nansac.

834
01:45:39,935 --> 01:45:42,085
I've done you no wrong.

835
01:45:42,255 --> 01:45:43,370
You're a Nansac.

836
01:45:43,535 --> 01:45:45,890
From Nansac castle, Nansac lands,

837
01:45:46,175 --> 01:45:47,449
a Nansac belly.

838
01:45:50,415 --> 01:45:51,484
Don't look like that!

839
01:45:53,015 --> 01:45:54,368
Go home, Galiote.

840
01:46:23,575 --> 01:46:24,610
Wait.

841
01:46:29,015 --> 01:46:30,164
Come back.

842
01:46:43,575 --> 01:46:44,451
Get undressed.

843
01:47:29,975 --> 01:47:31,886
Don't be mean to me.

844
01:47:33,335 --> 01:47:34,654
My father hates me.

845
01:47:35,935 --> 01:47:39,291
I'm the one who killed his wife
by being born.

846
01:47:50,775 --> 01:47:54,165
My sisters despise me
for shunning their debauchery.

847
01:47:59,495 --> 01:48:02,089
I wear men's clothes
to be left alone.

848
01:48:10,135 --> 01:48:12,330
Don't blame me
for protecting my father.

849
01:48:13,255 --> 01:48:14,813
I defend him just as...

850
01:48:15,455 --> 01:48:17,252
you defend your father's memory.

851
01:48:44,495 --> 01:48:45,484
Here.

852
01:48:59,055 --> 01:49:00,204
Dry now?

853
01:49:09,775 --> 01:49:10,412
Get out.

854
01:49:30,335 --> 01:49:32,166
No good will come of this.

855
01:49:40,735 --> 01:49:42,293
Hand over your sword.

856
01:49:43,015 --> 01:49:44,846
Hand it over.

857
01:49:47,895 --> 01:49:49,328
I've no quarrel with you.

858
01:49:53,135 --> 01:49:55,330
Stand back! Gang of swine!

859
01:50:05,415 --> 01:50:06,404
Who is she?

860
01:51:20,455 --> 01:51:22,286
Nansac!

861
01:51:52,415 --> 01:51:53,450
Sit down.

862
01:52:14,815 --> 01:52:15,850
Here it is!

863
01:52:20,095 --> 01:52:21,733
- Hold this.
- The lantern!

864
01:52:30,215 --> 01:52:30,965
Him!

865
01:52:34,975 --> 01:52:37,170
lmpossible! It can't be him.

866
01:52:37,895 --> 01:52:39,567
Raise the drawbridge!

867
01:52:53,855 --> 01:52:55,811
Pull harder!

868
01:53:06,095 --> 01:53:07,164
Silence!

869
01:53:07,895 --> 01:53:10,045
- What's up?
- Keep quiet and calm.

870
01:53:11,575 --> 01:53:13,167
You're safe in the castle.

871
01:53:40,735 --> 01:53:42,327
- To the Revolution!
- To Napoleon!

872
01:53:42,655 --> 01:53:43,849
This way.

873
01:54:03,455 --> 01:54:04,854
Heave, lads!

874
01:54:31,455 --> 01:54:32,888
You should flee, Sir.

875
01:54:33,055 --> 01:54:35,330
We'll let down ladders.
Take your family.

876
01:54:35,855 --> 01:54:37,288
Fight, cowards!

877
01:54:37,455 --> 01:54:39,491
Do flaming dolls and braggarts
scare you?

878
01:54:39,655 --> 01:54:42,044
I'm no coward.
The castle can't be held.

879
01:54:42,735 --> 01:54:44,691
We'll burn to death like rats!

880
01:54:44,855 --> 01:54:46,368
Shut up, cretin!

881
01:54:48,255 --> 01:54:49,290
Follow me.

882
01:56:02,815 --> 01:56:03,850
Form up!

883
01:56:05,455 --> 01:56:06,968
Hold your fire...

884
01:56:07,975 --> 01:56:09,044
Ready?

885
01:56:10,055 --> 01:56:10,851
Get set...

886
01:56:21,455 --> 01:56:23,286
Treachery! They're inside!

887
01:56:23,895 --> 01:56:26,045
Faster, lads!

888
01:56:27,775 --> 01:56:28,890
Everybody out!

889
01:56:31,415 --> 01:56:33,292
Flee, Sir Count!

890
01:56:33,695 --> 01:56:34,650
- Right buttock.
- Left!

891
01:57:08,135 --> 01:57:09,170
Nansac!

892
01:57:20,055 --> 01:57:22,523
Wretch! You unleashed your dogs

893
01:57:22,695 --> 01:57:24,048
but you're still an oaf.

894
01:57:24,935 --> 01:57:26,493
What do you know except mud

895
01:57:26,855 --> 01:57:28,208
and your cow's turds?

896
01:57:29,775 --> 01:57:31,174
You're nothing!

897
01:57:31,335 --> 01:57:33,644
All you do is destroy!
You leave no trace

898
01:57:33,815 --> 01:57:35,214
but a smear of shit!

899
01:57:36,015 --> 01:57:37,607
Go back to your hovels

900
01:57:38,055 --> 01:57:39,374
and pray for my mercy.

901
01:57:39,575 --> 01:57:40,530
He's brave.

902
01:57:41,175 --> 01:57:42,972
Wild boars are brave too,

903
01:57:43,295 --> 01:57:44,523
but they're still pigs.

904
01:57:45,015 --> 01:57:47,483
You'll end up like your father!

905
01:58:41,975 --> 01:58:43,203
Kill him!

906
01:59:08,855 --> 01:59:09,844
Let me through!

907
01:59:11,735 --> 01:59:13,293
Out of my way!

908
01:59:56,135 --> 01:59:57,727
Scared or tired?

909
02:00:01,655 --> 02:00:02,883
Scared, right?

910
02:00:12,215 --> 02:00:13,364
It's over, Nansac.

911
02:01:13,055 --> 02:01:14,204
Finish him off.

912
02:01:22,135 --> 02:01:23,204
I don't want his life.

913
02:01:25,175 --> 02:01:26,449
Get up!

914
02:01:29,215 --> 02:01:30,489
I want you to suffer

915
02:01:30,815 --> 02:01:32,726
the fate that awaits most of us.

916
02:01:36,015 --> 02:01:38,324
I want you to grow old in poverty,

917
02:01:39,015 --> 02:01:41,131
alone and toothless,

918
02:01:41,775 --> 02:01:45,006
clinging to your memories
to forget the hunger and cold

919
02:01:45,695 --> 02:01:47,572
of your paltry life.

920
02:01:49,975 --> 02:01:51,488
You're arrogant, Nansac.

921
02:01:52,855 --> 02:01:54,971
But when you're chewing
chestnut husks,

922
02:01:56,135 --> 02:01:57,853
there will be new life here

923
02:01:59,295 --> 02:02:02,651
and I'll have forgotten you.

924
02:02:12,135 --> 02:02:13,614
Get him out.

925
02:02:15,895 --> 02:02:17,294
And burn everything!

926
02:02:39,095 --> 02:02:40,289
Hurry up!

927
02:02:42,015 --> 02:02:43,892
Ten men with the Knight!

928
02:02:57,695 --> 02:02:59,048
Galiote's up there!

929
02:02:59,695 --> 02:03:02,971
She locked herself in.
She won't come out!

930
02:03:25,135 --> 02:03:27,091
Open the door!

931
02:04:20,175 --> 02:04:21,813
I knew you would come.

932
02:06:27,335 --> 02:06:28,734
Listen!

933
02:06:30,655 --> 02:06:32,054
Go home.

934
02:06:32,815 --> 02:06:34,612
In the next few days,

935
02:06:35,375 --> 02:06:37,286
some of us will be arrested.

936
02:06:38,215 --> 02:06:39,728
Have faith!

937
02:06:41,095 --> 02:06:42,608
All you did was obey.

938
02:06:42,775 --> 02:06:44,572
I'm the only one responsible.

939
02:06:48,935 --> 02:06:50,050
Thank you.

940
02:06:51,975 --> 02:06:54,694
His first 'thank you' in 15 years!
Hallelujah!

941
02:07:20,415 --> 02:07:21,450
Coming?

942
02:07:27,775 --> 02:07:29,527
I'll sleep in the woods tonight.

943
02:07:59,815 --> 02:08:03,171
The evidence before the court
is damning.

944
02:08:04,535 --> 02:08:06,253
It will reveal the ignominy,

945
02:08:06,655 --> 02:08:08,327
the vileness and hypocrisy

946
02:08:08,535 --> 02:08:10,332
of a man without scruples,

947
02:08:10,735 --> 02:08:11,850
without shame.

948
02:08:12,895 --> 02:08:14,533
A man hell-bent

949
02:08:14,695 --> 02:08:17,414
on mindless, unjust vengeance!

950
02:08:17,575 --> 02:08:19,884
A man who ruthlessly besmirched,

951
02:08:20,055 --> 02:08:21,374
humiliated and raped

952
02:08:21,895 --> 02:08:24,728
the Count's youngest daughter
during the raid.

953
02:08:24,895 --> 02:08:26,647
Silence in court!

954
02:08:27,655 --> 02:08:30,215
Bring in Miss Galienne de Nansac,

955
02:08:30,655 --> 02:08:32,407
known as 'Galiote'.

956
02:08:32,575 --> 02:08:36,170
It's make or break.
Your word against hers.

957
02:08:38,855 --> 02:08:40,288
Stay seated.

958
02:08:43,735 --> 02:08:47,887
Young lady, being under 18,
you need not take the oath,

959
02:08:48,055 --> 02:08:49,488
but let me remind you

960
02:08:49,695 --> 02:08:51,606
that your family's accusations

961
02:08:51,775 --> 02:08:53,447
are extremely grave

962
02:08:53,615 --> 02:08:56,209
and your statements or denials

963
02:08:56,375 --> 02:08:59,048
will strongly affect the verdict.

964
02:08:59,855 --> 02:09:00,571
Stand up.

965
02:09:05,015 --> 02:09:08,132
Do you know the man
standing in the dock?

966
02:09:09,735 --> 02:09:10,770
It's Jacquou.

967
02:09:12,135 --> 02:09:13,170
Jacquou Ferral.

968
02:09:13,615 --> 02:09:15,924
Very well. Mr. Prosecutor?

969
02:09:16,375 --> 02:09:17,091
Young lady,

970
02:09:18,295 --> 02:09:21,207
did that man assault you
on the night

971
02:09:21,375 --> 02:09:22,125
of June 14th...

972
02:09:25,575 --> 02:09:26,644
I said no.

973
02:09:28,775 --> 02:09:30,254
Compose yourself.

974
02:09:30,415 --> 02:09:31,928
Of all the people here,

975
02:09:32,095 --> 02:09:34,404
I have the most reason to hate him.

976
02:09:34,935 --> 02:09:38,086
I wounded him three times
on the night of the raid

977
02:09:38,815 --> 02:09:40,612
but he did not touch me.

978
02:09:40,775 --> 02:09:42,333
Not then or ever.

979
02:09:42,975 --> 02:09:45,045
You told
your father and sisters...

980
02:09:45,215 --> 02:09:45,965
Not true!

981
02:09:47,495 --> 02:09:48,564
I said nothing.

982
02:09:48,735 --> 02:09:50,487
The child is confused!

983
02:09:50,655 --> 02:09:52,247
Sir Count, please!

984
02:09:53,055 --> 02:09:53,646
Silence!

985
02:10:00,295 --> 02:10:02,729
Young lady,
I feel for your embarrassment

986
02:10:03,615 --> 02:10:04,445
but even so,

987
02:10:04,615 --> 02:10:07,209
after the raid,
you had his clothes on.

988
02:10:08,375 --> 02:10:10,491
Your Honor, neither he

989
02:10:10,695 --> 02:10:12,526
nor any man has ever touched me.

990
02:10:12,695 --> 02:10:13,764
I can prove it.

991
02:10:14,335 --> 02:10:16,405
Let a doctor examine me.

992
02:10:22,335 --> 02:10:23,734
I am a virgin.

993
02:10:26,215 --> 02:10:27,807
The only one here!

994
02:10:53,135 --> 02:10:56,252
The King has abdicated.
The Ultras have lost power.

995
02:11:02,135 --> 02:11:03,124
Those people,

996
02:11:03,375 --> 02:11:05,366
baying for blood,

997
02:11:05,775 --> 02:11:07,606
are the ones who should be there

998
02:11:07,895 --> 02:11:09,044
in the dock!

999
02:11:13,255 --> 02:11:14,404
Silence in court!

1000
02:11:15,335 --> 02:11:17,644
Counselor,
don't overstate your case.

1001
02:11:17,815 --> 02:11:20,409
This trial belongs to a history

1002
02:11:20,735 --> 02:11:22,327
of peasants' revolts

1003
02:11:22,495 --> 02:11:24,008
provoked by cruelty,

1004
02:11:24,295 --> 02:11:27,810
gross arrogance
and brutal oppression...

1005
02:11:58,335 --> 02:11:59,404
We're free!

1006
02:12:20,935 --> 02:12:22,812
The Marquis said he'd drive us home.

1007
02:12:23,055 --> 02:12:25,774
Forget it. You're ruined.
We'll have to walk.

1008
02:12:34,575 --> 02:12:36,486
We're dead, my friend.

1009
02:13:08,535 --> 02:13:09,251
Hello, Lina.

1010
02:13:11,935 --> 02:13:15,166
I've come on a rather odd errand.

1011
02:13:15,495 --> 02:13:16,848
Don't go, Lina.

1012
02:13:17,855 --> 02:13:20,130
Galiote has found
a housekeeping job in London.

1013
02:13:20,735 --> 02:13:23,693
She's taking the four o'clock boat.

1014
02:13:24,575 --> 02:13:26,054
She asked me...

1015
02:13:28,215 --> 02:13:30,092
She wants to see you one last time.

1016
02:13:34,455 --> 02:13:36,093
That's what I told her.

1017
02:13:36,855 --> 02:13:37,492
Wait.

1018
02:13:38,815 --> 02:13:40,453
You owe her your freedom.

1019
02:13:40,695 --> 02:13:42,413
It's only fair. Go.

1020
02:13:47,095 --> 02:13:48,210
Go on!

1021
02:14:07,375 --> 02:14:08,444
He'll come back.

1022
02:14:10,415 --> 02:14:11,689
Should I go with him?

1023
02:15:01,575 --> 02:15:03,133
No family, friends, servants...

1024
02:15:04,175 --> 02:15:05,085
Nobody's here

1025
02:15:05,375 --> 02:15:07,491
except my worst enemy

1026
02:15:09,495 --> 02:15:11,133
who ruined my name and family.

1027
02:15:17,975 --> 02:15:20,364
I need to know if you still hate me.

1028
02:15:29,375 --> 02:15:30,649
Farewell.

1029
02:15:48,175 --> 02:15:50,769
Thank you for coming, anyway.

1030
02:16:04,975 --> 02:16:06,010
Wait.

1031
02:16:40,095 --> 02:16:41,733
Won't you miss the forest?

1032
02:16:42,415 --> 02:16:43,894
The forest, no.

1033
02:16:45,095 --> 02:16:48,132
There are forests
all over the world.
