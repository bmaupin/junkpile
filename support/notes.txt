DO:
ranks
    ranks db takes >5 seconds to create, either fix this or show progress
get chapter selection working
    -try getting dialog results?
        apress p. 210ish
        dialog1.getValue1()
    -try implementing setOnDismissListener()
        http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/dialogs.html
card chooser: see below
see wrox p. 175ish for calling an activity and getting results
we'll need to store favorites and noshow in a separate db so they don't get overwritten...
    we can create this db from within android
should everything be global (class) variables, or should we pass them back and forth?
handle swiping left/right to change cards
    can we steal this from Google's homescreen code?  :P

post on 2 authors sites: why doesn't reshaper work with other fonts?
using this library: http://github.com/AhmedEssam/Better-Arabic-Reshaper
to fix in words
    duplicate English words with differing Arabic words got screwed up somewhere...
        to come, green, 
    clean up/remove/update categories
        abstract?
        titles?
if English > certain length: decrease font size (so it fits on the card)
same for Arabic?
fix right-to-leftness in cards?
    is there a left vs. right space?
    parenthesis seems to be messed up before letter with vowel (without vowel seems fine)
        and at the end of words
    or do i need to add codes so entire word is rtl, including parentheses?
    same problems with slashes!


CLEANUP:
    will we be using getChapters in more than one activity?
        if so, put it in the db class


DONE?
memory leak
    db needs to be closed during onpause, onstop, or somewhere
do we need to close the database helper?
    what's the standard way to handle the database?
every time phone orientation is changed, onpause, onstop, oncreate, onstart, onresume is called
    change it so it doesn't kill activity every time orientation is changed
store plurals separately in db?
make it so changing the settings takes effect immediately, instead of the next time the app is closed/reopened
make english text smaller and/or arabic bigger


QUESTIONS
how do we handle database queries spread throughout the app?  should they all be in the database class?  or all in the main class (since it has to be open anyway)?  if they're spread out, should we create a public cursor that all classes can access?
    I'd like to use one cursor, created elsewhere, but if that activity gets closed, it'll kill my cursor, right?

cards:
separate arabic plurals in db
for english strings, remove (s), (es), (ies), (pl), (women), (men), (and pl), (& pl.), (ren), (& pl)
(make sure to remove initial space too, if exists)
handle english2 for arabic months


cards fix:
improper spelling of good evening
add missing arabic plurals
handle these:
ENGLISH2: (weak version)
ENGLISH2: (f pl)
ENGLISH2: (m/f)
ENGLISH2: (m sg)
ENGLISH2: (m/f)
ENGLISH2: (m/f)
ENGLISH2: (polite)
ENGLISH2: (adj)
ENGLISH2: (m and f)

CARD CHOOSER (select cards?):
all
AWS chapters
    get these from db
parts of speech (noun, verb, phrases, ...)
    have "other" category which comprises participles, particles, untagged?
    statically defined in an array
categories (food, places, etc.)
    get from db, optionally captitalize first letter?

after you choose cards to show, you're given option of in order or random
    perhaps the first time you run the program, it can:
        ask you whether or not you want to show plurals
        which lanugage to show on the front of cards
        ask you whether or not you want to show vowels?
        show the help screen (left, right, up, down)
