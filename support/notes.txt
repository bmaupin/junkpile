DO:
see wrox p. 175ish for calling an activity and getting results
we'll need to store favorites and noshow in a separate db so they don't get overwritten...
    we can create this db from within android
should everything be global (class) variables, or should we pass them back and forth?
handle swiping left/right to change cards
    can we steal this from Google's homescreen code?  :P

post on 2 authors sites: why doesn't reshaper work with other fonts?
using this library: http://github.com/AhmedEssam/Better-Arabic-Reshaper
once nouns are labeled, remove "other" label (to make db smaller).  we can handle this in code.
to fix in words
    hamza
    baa + dash
    lam-alef

DONE?
memory leak
    db needs to be closed during onpause, onstop, or somewhere
do we need to close the database helper?
    what's the standard way to handle the database?
every time phone orientation is changed, onpause, onstop, oncreate, onstart, onresume is called
    change it so it doesn't kill activity every time orientation is changed
store plurals separately in db?
make it so changing the settings takes effect immediately, instead of the next time the app is closed/reopened
make english text smaller and/or arabic bigger


QUESTIONS
how do we handle database queries spread throughout the app?  should they all be in the database class?  or all in the main class (since it has to be open anyway)?  if they're spread out, should we create a public cursor that all classes can access?
    I'd like to use one cursor, created elsewhere, but if that activity gets closed, it'll kill my cursor, right?

cards:
separate arabic plurals in db
for english strings, remove (s), (es), (ies), (pl), (women), (men), (and pl), (& pl.), (ren), (& pl)
(make sure to remove initial space too, if exists)
handle english2 for arabic months


cards fix:
improper spelling of good evening
add missing arabic plurals
handle these:
ENGLISH2: (weak version)
ENGLISH2: (f pl)
ENGLISH2: (m/f)
ENGLISH2: (m sg)
ENGLISH2: (m/f)
ENGLISH2: (m/f)
ENGLISH2: (polite)
ENGLISH2: (adj)
ENGLISH2: (m and f)
